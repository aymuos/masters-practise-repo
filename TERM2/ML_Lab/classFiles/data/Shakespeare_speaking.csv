Speaker,Sentence
MENENIUS,"What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you."
MENENIUS,"Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves?"
MENENIUS,"I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies."
MENENIUS,"Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tale"
MENENIUS,"There was a time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it"
MENENIUS,"Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
For, look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you."
MENENIUS,"What then?
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?"
MENENIUS,"Well, what then?"
MENENIUS,"I will tell you
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer."
MENENIUS,"Note me this, good friend;
Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd"
MENENIUS,"'Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the flour of all,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?"
MENENIUS,"The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
You, the great toe of this assembly?"
MENENIUS,"For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost"
MENENIUS,"For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
The city is well stored."
MENENIUS,"Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
What says the other troop?"
MENENIUS,What is granted them?
MENENIUS,This is strange.
COMINIUS,You have fought together.
COMINIUS,It is your former promise.
MENENIUS,"O, true-bred!"
COMINIUS,Noble Marcius!
SICINIUS,Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
BRUTUS,He has no equal.
SICINIUS,"When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--"
BRUTUS,Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
SICINIUS,Nay. but his taunts.
BRUTUS,"Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods."
SICINIUS,Be-mock the modest moon.
BRUTUS,The present wars devour him
SICINIUS,"Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon"
BRUTUS,"Fame, at the which he aims,
In whom already he's well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first"
SICINIUS,"Besides, if things go well,
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius."
BRUTUS,Come
SICINIUS,"Let's hence, and hear
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action."
BRUTUS,Lets along.
COMINIUS,"Breathe you, my friends"
COMINIUS,"Though thou speak'st truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well.
How long is't since?"
COMINIUS,'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums
COMINIUS,"Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him thus."
COMINIUS,"The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man."
COMINIUS,"Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own."
COMINIUS,"Flower of warriors,
How is it with Titus Lartius?"
COMINIUS,"Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? call him hither."
COMINIUS,But how prevail'd you?
COMINIUS,"Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose."
COMINIUS,"As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope."
COMINIUS,"Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking"
COMINIUS,"March on, my fellows"
COMINIUS,"If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds"
COMINIUS,"You shall not be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The value of her own"
COMINIUS,"Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the common distribution, at
Your only choice."
COMINIUS,"Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly"
CORIOLANUS,"I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no"
COMINIUS,"So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back"
CORIOLANUS,"The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my lord general."
COMINIUS,Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
CORIOLANUS,"I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly"
COMINIUS,"O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus."
CORIOLANUS,"By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?"
COMINIUS,Go we to our tent
MENENIUS,The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
BRUTUS,Good or bad?
MENENIUS,"Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
love not Marcius."
SICINIUS,Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
MENENIUS,"Pray you, who does the wolf love?"
SICINIUS,The lamb.
MENENIUS,"Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
noble Marcius."
BRUTUS,"He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear."
MENENIUS,"He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
are old men"
MENENIUS,"In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
have not in abundance?"
BRUTUS,"He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all."
SICINIUS,Especially in pride.
BRUTUS,And topping all others in boasting.
MENENIUS,This is strange now
MENENIUS,"Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?"
MENENIUS,"Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience"
BRUTUS,"We do it not alone, sir."
MENENIUS,"I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
single"
BRUTUS,"What then, sir?"
MENENIUS,"Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
any in Rome."
SICINIUS,"Menenius, you are known well enough too."
MENENIUS,"I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning"
BRUTUS,"Come, sir, come, we know you well enough."
MENENIUS,"You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs"
BRUTUS,"Come, come, you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol."
MENENIUS,"Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worships"
MENENIUS,Ha! Marcius coming home!
MENENIUS,"Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home!"
MENENIUS,I will make my very house reel tonight
MENENIUS,"A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
the physician"
MENENIUS,"So do I too, if it be not too much"
MENENIUS,Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
MENENIUS,"And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that"
MENENIUS,"Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
true purchasing."
MENENIUS,"True! I'll be sworn they are true.
Where is he wounded?
God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
home"
MENENIUS,"One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
nine that I know."
MENENIUS,Now it's twenty-seven
CORIOLANUS,No more of this; it does offend my heart
COMINIUS,"Look, sir, your mother!"
CORIOLANUS,"O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!"
CORIOLANUS,"My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons."
MENENIUS,"Now, the gods crown thee!"
CORIOLANUS,"And live you yet?
O my sweet lady, pardon."
MENENIUS,"A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote on"
COMINIUS,Ever right.
CORIOLANUS,"Menenius ever, ever."
CORIOLANUS,""
CORIOLANUS,"Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs."
COMINIUS,"On, to the Capitol!"
BRUTUS,"All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him"
SICINIUS,"On the sudden,
I warrant him consul."
BRUTUS,"Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep."
SICINIUS,"He cannot temperately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won."
BRUTUS,In that there's comfort.
SICINIUS,"Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours, which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do't."
BRUTUS,"I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, beg their stinking breaths."
SICINIUS,'Tis right.
BRUTUS,It was his word
SICINIUS,"I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution."
BRUTUS,'Tis most like he will.
SICINIUS,"It shall be to him then as our good wills,
A sure destruction."
BRUTUS,"So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
In human action and capacity,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in the war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them."
SICINIUS,"This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever."
BRUTUS,What's the matter?
BRUTUS,"Let's to the Capitol;
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
But hearts for the event."
SICINIUS,Have with you.
MENENIUS,"Having determined of the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country"
SICINIUS,"We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly."
BRUTUS,"Which the rather
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at."
MENENIUS,"That's off, that's off;
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?"
BRUTUS,"Most willingly;
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it."
MENENIUS,"He loves your people
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your place."
CORIOLANUS,Your horror's pardon
BRUTUS,"Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not."
CORIOLANUS,"No, sir"
MENENIUS,"Pray now, sit down."
CORIOLANUS,"I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd."
MENENIUS,"Masters of the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius."
COMINIUS,I shall lack voice
MENENIUS,Worthy man!
COMINIUS,"Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world"
MENENIUS,He's right noble
MENENIUS,"The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
To make thee consul."
CORIOLANUS,"I do owe them still
My life and services."
MENENIUS,"It then remains
That you do speak to the people."
CORIOLANUS,"I do beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage"
SICINIUS,"Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony."
MENENIUS,Put them not to't
CORIOLANUS,"It is apart
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people."
BRUTUS,Mark you that?
CORIOLANUS,"To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire
Of their breath only!"
MENENIUS,"Do not stand upon't.
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
Our purpose to them"
BRUTUS,You see how he intends to use the people.
SICINIUS,"May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give."
BRUTUS,"Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here"
MENENIUS,"O sir, you are not right"
CORIOLANUS,"What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace"
MENENIUS,"O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that"
CORIOLANUS,"Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em."
MENENIUS,You'll mar all
CORIOLANUS,"Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
So, here comes a brace.
You know the cause, air, of my standing here."
CORIOLANUS,Mine own desert.
CORIOLANUS,"Ay, but not mine own desire."
CORIOLANUS,"No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging."
CORIOLANUS,"Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?"
CORIOLANUS,"Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't"
CORIOLANUS,"A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
begged. I have your alms"
CORIOLANUS,"Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul, I have here the
customary gown."
CORIOLANUS,Your enigma?
CORIOLANUS,"You should account me the more virtuous that I have
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
gentle"
CORIOLANUS,"I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further."
CORIOLANUS,"Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't"
CORIOLANUS,Worthy voices!
MENENIUS,"You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice"
CORIOLANUS,Is this done?
SICINIUS,The custom of request you have discharged
CORIOLANUS,Where? at the senate-house?
SICINIUS,"There, Coriolanus."
CORIOLANUS,May I change these garments?
SICINIUS,"You may, sir."
CORIOLANUS,"That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house."
MENENIUS,I'll keep you company. Will you along?
BRUTUS,We stay here for the people.
SICINIUS,"Fare you well.
He has it now, and by his looks methink
'Tis warm at 's heart."
BRUTUS,"With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?"
SICINIUS,"How now, my masters! have you chose this man?"
BRUTUS,We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
SICINIUS,"Why, so he did, I am sure."
SICINIUS,"Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?"
BRUTUS,"Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord."
SICINIUS,"Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected."
BRUTUS,"Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves, and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?"
SICINIUS,"Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?"
BRUTUS,"Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties; make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so."
SICINIUS,"Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
The apprehension of his present portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you."
BRUTUS,"Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him."
SICINIUS,"Say, you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul"
BRUTUS,"Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his great ancestor."
SICINIUS,"One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances"
BRUTUS,"Say, you ne'er had done't--
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol."
BRUTUS,"Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater"
SICINIUS,"To the Capitol, come"
CORIOLANUS,Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
CORIOLANUS,"So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again."
COMINIUS,"They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again."
CORIOLANUS,Saw you Aufidius?
CORIOLANUS,Spoke he of me?
CORIOLANUS,How? what?
CORIOLANUS,At Antium lives he?
CORIOLANUS,"I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth"
SICINIUS,Pass no further.
CORIOLANUS,Ha! what is that?
BRUTUS,It will be dangerous to go on
CORIOLANUS,What makes this change?
MENENIUS,The matter?
COMINIUS,Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
BRUTUS,"Cominius, no."
CORIOLANUS,Have I had children's voices?
BRUTUS,The people are incensed against him.
SICINIUS,"Stop,
Or all will fall in broil."
CORIOLANUS,"Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?"
MENENIUS,"Be calm, be calm."
CORIOLANUS,"It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility"
BRUTUS,Call't not a plot
CORIOLANUS,"Why, this was known before."
BRUTUS,Not to them all.
CORIOLANUS,Have you inform'd them sithence?
BRUTUS,How! I inform them!
CORIOLANUS,You are like to do such business.
BRUTUS,"Not unlike,
Each way, to better yours."
CORIOLANUS,"Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune."
SICINIUS,"You show too much of that
For which the people stir"
MENENIUS,Let's be calm.
COMINIUS,"The people are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit."
CORIOLANUS,"Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--"
MENENIUS,"Not now, not now."
CORIOLANUS,"Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons"
MENENIUS,"Well, no more."
CORIOLANUS,"How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them."
BRUTUS,"You speak o' the people,
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity."
SICINIUS,"'Twere well
We let the people know't."
MENENIUS,"What, what? his choler?"
CORIOLANUS,"Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!"
SICINIUS,"It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further."
CORIOLANUS,"Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?"
COMINIUS,'Twas from the canon.
CORIOLANUS,"'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be senators"
COMINIUS,"Well, on to the market-place."
CORIOLANUS,"Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,--"
MENENIUS,"Well, well, no more of that."
CORIOLANUS,"Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state."
BRUTUS,"Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?"
CORIOLANUS,"I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
That ne'er did service for't"
MENENIUS,"Come, enough."
BRUTUS,"Enough, with over-measure."
CORIOLANUS,"No, take more"
BRUTUS,Has said enough.
SICINIUS,"Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
As traitors do."
CORIOLANUS,"Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench"
BRUTUS,Manifest treason!
SICINIUS,This a consul? no.
BRUTUS,"The aediles, ho!
Let him be apprehended."
SICINIUS,"Go, call the people"
CORIOLANUS,"Hence, old goat!"
COMINIUS,"Aged sir, hands off."
CORIOLANUS,"Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments."
SICINIUS,"Help, ye citizens!"
MENENIUS,On both sides more respect.
SICINIUS,Here's he that would take from you all your power.
BRUTUS,"Seize him, AEdiles!"
MENENIUS,"What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius."
SICINIUS,"Hear me, people; peace!"
SICINIUS,You are at point to lose your liberties
MENENIUS,"Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench."
SICINIUS,What is the city but the people?
BRUTUS,"By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The people's magistrates."
MENENIUS,And so are like to do.
COMINIUS,"That is the way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin."
SICINIUS,This deserves death.
BRUTUS,"Or let us stand to our authority,
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of present death."
SICINIUS,"Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction cast him."
BRUTUS,"AEdiles, seize him!"
MENENIUS,"Hear me one word;
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word."
MENENIUS,""
BRUTUS,"Sir, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
And bear him to the rock."
CORIOLANUS,"No, I'll die here.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting"
MENENIUS,"Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile."
BRUTUS,Lay hands upon him.
COMINIUS,"Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old!"
MENENIUS,"Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else."
COMINIUS,"Stand fast;
We have as many friends as enemies."
MENENIUS,Sham it be put to that?
MENENIUS,"For 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot tent yourself"
COMINIUS,"Come, sir, along with us."
CORIOLANUS,"I would they were barbarians--as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--"
MENENIUS,"Be gone;
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
One time will owe another."
CORIOLANUS,"On fair ground
I could beat forty of them."
COMINIUS,"I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes"
MENENIUS,"Pray you, be gone"
COMINIUS,"Nay, come away."
MENENIUS,His nature is too noble for the world
MENENIUS,"I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
Could he not speak 'em fair?"
SICINIUS,"Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?"
MENENIUS,"You worthy tribunes,--"
SICINIUS,"He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands"
MENENIUS,"Sir, sir,--"
SICINIUS,Peace!
MENENIUS,"Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
With modest warrant."
SICINIUS,"Sir, how comes't that you
Have holp to make this rescue?"
MENENIUS,Hear me speak
SICINIUS,Consul! what consul?
MENENIUS,The consul Coriolanus.
BRUTUS,He consul!
MENENIUS,"If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time."
SICINIUS,"Speak briefly then;
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor"
MENENIUS,"Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!"
SICINIUS,He's a disease that must be cut away.
MENENIUS,"O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country,
Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
A brand to the end o' the world."
SICINIUS,This is clean kam.
BRUTUS,Merely awry
MENENIUS,"The service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was."
BRUTUS,"We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence"
MENENIUS,"One word more, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
And sack great Rome with Romans."
BRUTUS,"If it were so,--"
SICINIUS,"What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come."
MENENIUS,Consider this
SICINIUS,"Noble Menenius,
Be you then as the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons."
BRUTUS,Go not home.
SICINIUS,Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there
MENENIUS,"I'll bring him to you.
Let me desire your company"
CORIOLANUS,"Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them."
CORIOLANUS,"I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war.
I talk of you"
CORIOLANUS,Let go.
CORIOLANUS,Let them hang.
MENENIUS,"Come, come, you have been too rough, something
too rough;
You must return and mend it."
MENENIUS,"Well said, noble woman?
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear."
CORIOLANUS,What must I do?
MENENIUS,Return to the tribunes.
CORIOLANUS,"Well, what then? what then?"
MENENIUS,Repent what you have spoke.
CORIOLANUS,"For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?"
CORIOLANUS,"Tush, tush!"
MENENIUS,A good demand.
CORIOLANUS,Why force you this?
MENENIUS,"Noble lady!
Come, go with us; speak fair"
MENENIUS,"This but done,
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
As words to little purpose."
COMINIUS,"I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make strong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence"
MENENIUS,Only fair speech.
COMINIUS,"I think 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit."
CORIOLANUS,"Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't"
COMINIUS,"Come, come, we'll prompt you."
CORIOLANUS,"Well, I must do't"
CORIOLANUS,"Pray, be content"
COMINIUS,Away! the tribunes do attend you
CORIOLANUS,"The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go"
MENENIUS,"Ay, but mildly."
CORIOLANUS,"Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!"
BRUTUS,"In this point charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical power"
BRUTUS,How accompanied?
SICINIUS,"Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll?"
SICINIUS,Have you collected them by tribes?
SICINIUS,"Assemble presently the people hither;
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' the truth o' the cause."
BRUTUS,"And when such time they have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence."
SICINIUS,"Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall hap to give 't them."
BRUTUS,"Go about it.
Put him to choler straight"
SICINIUS,"Well, here he comes."
MENENIUS,"Calmly, I do beseech you."
CORIOLANUS,"Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war!"
MENENIUS,A noble wish.
SICINIUS,"Draw near, ye people."
CORIOLANUS,"First, hear me speak."
CORIOLANUS,"Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?"
SICINIUS,"I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices,
Allow their officers and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
As shall be proved upon you?"
CORIOLANUS,I am content.
MENENIUS,"Lo, citizens, he says he is content"
CORIOLANUS,"Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only."
MENENIUS,"Consider further,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier"
COMINIUS,"Well, well, no more."
CORIOLANUS,"What is the matter
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
You take it off again?"
SICINIUS,Answer to us.
CORIOLANUS,"Say, then"
SICINIUS,"We charge you, that you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people."
CORIOLANUS,How! traitor!
MENENIUS,"Nay, temperately; your promise."
CORIOLANUS,"The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods."
SICINIUS,"Mark you this, people?"
SICINIUS,"Peace!
We need not put new matter to his charge"
BRUTUS,"But since he hath
Served well for Rome,--"
CORIOLANUS,What do you prate of service?
BRUTUS,"I talk of that, that know it."
CORIOLANUS,You?
MENENIUS,Is this the promise that you made your mother?
COMINIUS,"Know, I pray you,--"
CORIOLANUS,I know no further
SICINIUS,"For that he has,
As much as in him lies, from time to time
Envied against the people, seeking means
To pluck away their power, as now at last
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
Even from this instant, banish him our city,
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates"
COMINIUS,"Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--"
SICINIUS,He's sentenced; no more hearing.
COMINIUS,Let me speak
SICINIUS,We know your drift
BRUTUS,"There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country"
CORIOLANUS,"You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair! Have the power still
To banish your defenders; till at length
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows! Despising,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back"
SICINIUS,"Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
As he hath followed you, with all despite;
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through the city."
CORIOLANUS,"Come, leave your tears"
CORIOLANUS,"Nay! prithee, woman,--"
CORIOLANUS,"What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother"
CORIOLANUS,O the gods!
COMINIUS,"I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee"
CORIOLANUS,Fare ye well
MENENIUS,"That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
If I could shake off but one seven years
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
I'ld with thee every foot."
CORIOLANUS,Give me thy hand
SICINIUS,"Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf."
BRUTUS,"Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Than when it was a-doing."
SICINIUS,Bid them home
BRUTUS,"Dismiss them home.
Here comes his mother."
SICINIUS,Let's not meet her.
BRUTUS,Why?
SICINIUS,They say she's mad.
BRUTUS,They have ta'en note of us
MENENIUS,"Peace, peace; be not so loud."
SICINIUS,Are you mankind?
SICINIUS,O blessed heavens!
SICINIUS,What then?
MENENIUS,"Come, come, peace."
SICINIUS,"I would he had continued to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The noble knot he made."
BRUTUS,I would he had.
BRUTUS,"Pray, let us go."
BRUTUS,"Well, well, we'll leave you."
SICINIUS,"Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits?"
MENENIUS,"You have told them home;
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?"
MENENIUS,"Fie, fie, fie!"
CORIOLANUS,"A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made thy widows"
CORIOLANUS,"Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great Aufidius lies"
CORIOLANUS,"Which is his house, beseech you?"
CORIOLANUS,"Thank you, sir"
CORIOLANUS,A goodly house
CORIOLANUS,"I have deserved no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanus."
CORIOLANUS,Away!
CORIOLANUS,Now thou'rt troublesome.
CORIOLANUS,Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
CORIOLANUS,A gentleman.
CORIOLANUS,"True, so I am."
CORIOLANUS,"Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits."
CORIOLANUS,Under the canopy.
CORIOLANUS,Ay.
CORIOLANUS,I' the city of kites and crows.
CORIOLANUS,"No, I serve not thy master."
CORIOLANUS,"Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!"
CORIOLANUS,"If, Tullus,
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself."
CORIOLANUS,"A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine."
CORIOLANUS,Prepare thy brow to frown
CORIOLANUS,"My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus"
CORIOLANUS,"You bless me, gods!"
SICINIUS,"We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly."
BRUTUS,"We stood to't in good time.
Is this Menenius?"
SICINIUS,"'Tis he,'tis he"
MENENIUS,Hail to you both!
SICINIUS,"Your Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends"
MENENIUS,"All's well; and might have been much better, if
He could have temporized."
SICINIUS,"Where is he, hear you?"
MENENIUS,"Nay, I hear nothing"
SICINIUS,"God-den, our neighbours."
BRUTUS,"God-den to you all, god-den to you all."
SICINIUS,"Live, and thrive!"
BRUTUS,"Farewell, kind neighbours"
SICINIUS,"This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
Crying confusion."
BRUTUS,"Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,--"
SICINIUS,"And affecting one sole throne,
Without assistance."
MENENIUS,I think not so.
SICINIUS,"We should by this, to all our lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so."
BRUTUS,"The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and still without him."
MENENIUS,"'Tis Aufidius,
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And durst not once peep out."
SICINIUS,"Come, what talk you
Of Marcius?"
BRUTUS,"Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us."
MENENIUS,"Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
And three examples of the like have been
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded."
SICINIUS,Tell not me
BRUTUS,Not possible.
SICINIUS,"'Tis this slave;--
Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes"
SICINIUS,What more fearful?
SICINIUS,This is most likely!
BRUTUS,"Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again."
SICINIUS,The very trick on't.
MENENIUS,This is unlikely
COMINIUS,"O, you have made good work!"
MENENIUS,What news? what news?
COMINIUS,"You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--"
MENENIUS,What's the news? what's the news?
COMINIUS,"Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an auger's bore."
MENENIUS,"Pray now, your news?
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--"
COMINIUS,"If!
He is their god"
MENENIUS,"You have made good work,
You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of garlic-eaters!"
COMINIUS,"He will shake
Your Rome about your ears."
MENENIUS,"As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!"
BRUTUS,"But is this true, sir?"
COMINIUS,"Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find something in him."
MENENIUS,"We are all undone, unless
The noble man have mercy."
COMINIUS,"Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds"
MENENIUS,'Tis true
COMINIUS,"You have brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
So incapable of help."
MENENIUS,"How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
Who did hoot him out o' the city."
COMINIUS,"But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer"
MENENIUS,"Here come the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a whip"
COMINIUS,"Ye re goodly things, you voices!"
MENENIUS,"You have made
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?"
COMINIUS,"O, ay, what else?"
SICINIUS,"Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd"
BRUTUS,I do not like this news.
SICINIUS,Nor I.
BRUTUS,"Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!"
SICINIUS,"Pray, let us go."
MENENIUS,"No, I'll not go"
COMINIUS,He would not seem to know me.
MENENIUS,Do you hear?
COMINIUS,Yet one time he did call me by my name
MENENIUS,"Why, so"
COMINIUS,"I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected"
MENENIUS,Very well
COMINIUS,"I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends"
MENENIUS,"For one poor grain or two!
I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains"
SICINIUS,"Nay, pray, be patient"
MENENIUS,"No, I'll not meddle."
SICINIUS,"Pray you, go to him."
MENENIUS,What should I do?
BRUTUS,"Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius."
MENENIUS,"Well, and say that Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Unheard; what then?
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness? say't be so?"
SICINIUS,"Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
As you intended well."
MENENIUS,I'll undertake 't
BRUTUS,"You know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot lose your way."
MENENIUS,"Good faith, I'll prove him,
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success."
COMINIUS,He'll never hear him.
SICINIUS,Not?
COMINIUS,"I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his speechless hand"
MENENIUS,You guard like men; 'tis well
MENENIUS,From Rome.
MENENIUS,"Good my friends,
If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius."
MENENIUS,"I tell thee, fellow,
The general is my lover"
MENENIUS,"Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
always factionary on the party of your general."
MENENIUS,"Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
speak with him till after dinner."
MENENIUS,"I am, as thy general is."
MENENIUS,"Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
use me with estimation."
MENENIUS,"I mean, thy general."
MENENIUS,"Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--"
CORIOLANUS,What's the matter?
MENENIUS,"Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you"
CORIOLANUS,Away!
MENENIUS,How! away!
CORIOLANUS,"Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Are servanted to others"
MENENIUS,I neither care for the world nor your general
CORIOLANUS,"We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
I have borne this business."
CORIOLANUS,"This last old man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Loved me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
The first conditions, which they did refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to"
CORIOLANUS,These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
CORIOLANUS,"Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted"
CORIOLANUS,"What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot be, slight work."
CORIOLANUS,"The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple"
CORIOLANUS,"The god of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And saving those that eye thee!"
CORIOLANUS,That's my brave boy!
CORIOLANUS,"I beseech you, peace"
CORIOLANUS,"Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?"
CORIOLANUS,"Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat too long."
CORIOLANUS,"O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?"
CORIOLANUS,I dare be sworn you were
CORIOLANUS,"Ay, by and by;
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A better witness back than words, which we,
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you"
MENENIUS,"See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
corner-stone?"
SICINIUS,"Why, what of that?"
MENENIUS,"If it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
But I say there is no hope in't"
SICINIUS,"Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man!"
MENENIUS,"There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon"
SICINIUS,He loved his mother dearly.
MENENIUS,So did he me
SICINIUS,"Yes, mercy, if you report him truly."
MENENIUS,"I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
mother shall bring from him"
SICINIUS,The gods be good unto us!
MENENIUS,"No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us."
SICINIUS,What's the news?
SICINIUS,"Friend,
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?"
MENENIUS,This is good news
SICINIUS,"First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulness."
SICINIUS,They are near the city?
SICINIUS,"We will meet them,
And help the joy."
CORIOLANUS,"Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Under your great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action. We have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans"
CORIOLANUS,Traitor! how now!
CORIOLANUS,Marcius!
CORIOLANUS,"Hear'st thou, Mars?"
CORIOLANUS,Ha!
CORIOLANUS,"Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie"
CORIOLANUS,"Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli"
CORIOLANUS,"O that I had him,
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
To use my lawful sword!"
GLOUCESTER,"Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity"
CLARENCE,"His majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower."
GLOUCESTER,Upon what cause?
CLARENCE,Because my name is George.
GLOUCESTER,"Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
He should, for that, commit your godfathers"
CLARENCE,"Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
As yet I do not"
GLOUCESTER,"Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women"
CLARENCE,"By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?"
GLOUCESTER,"Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
If we will keep in favour with the king,
To be her men and wear her livery"
GLOUCESTER,"Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
You may partake of any thing we say"
GLOUCESTER,"Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone."
GLOUCESTER,"Her husband, knave"
CLARENCE,"We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey."
GLOUCESTER,"We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Brother, farewell"
CLARENCE,I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
GLOUCESTER,"Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
Meantime, have patience."
CLARENCE,I must perforce. Farewell.
GLOUCESTER,"Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?"
GLOUCESTER,"As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?"
GLOUCESTER,"No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
For they that were your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd as much on him as you."
GLOUCESTER,What news abroad?
GLOUCESTER,"Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
And overmuch consumed his royal person"
GLOUCESTER,"Go you before, and I will follow you.
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live"
GLOUCESTER,"Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down."
GLOUCESTER,"Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys."
GLOUCESTER,"Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command"
GLOUCESTER,"Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst."
GLOUCESTER,"Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses."
GLOUCESTER,"But I know none, and therefore am no beast."
GLOUCESTER,"More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself."
GLOUCESTER,"Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself."
GLOUCESTER,"By such despair, I should accuse myself."
GLOUCESTER,Say that I slew them not?
GLOUCESTER,I did not kill your husband.
GLOUCESTER,"Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand."
GLOUCESTER,"I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders."
GLOUCESTER,I grant ye.
GLOUCESTER,"The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him."
GLOUCESTER,"Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
For he was fitter for that place than earth."
GLOUCESTER,"Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it."
GLOUCESTER,Your bed-chamber.
GLOUCESTER,"So will it, madam till I lie with you."
GLOUCESTER,"I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?"
GLOUCESTER,"Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty"
GLOUCESTER,"These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You should not blemish it, if I stood by"
GLOUCESTER,"Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both."
GLOUCESTER,"It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be revenged on him that loveth you."
GLOUCESTER,"He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Did it to help thee to a better husband."
GLOUCESTER,He lives that loves thee better than he could.
GLOUCESTER,Plantagenet.
GLOUCESTER,"The selfsame name, but one of better nature."
GLOUCESTER,"Here.
Why dost thou spit at me?"
GLOUCESTER,Never came poison from so sweet a place.
GLOUCESTER,"Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine."
GLOUCESTER,"I would they were, that I might die at once;
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops"
GLOUCESTER,"Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it."
GLOUCESTER,"Tush, that was in thy rage"
GLOUCESTER,'Tis figured in my tongue.
GLOUCESTER,Then never man was true.
GLOUCESTER,"Say, then, my peace is made."
GLOUCESTER,But shall I live in hope?
GLOUCESTER,Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
GLOUCESTER,"Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever."
GLOUCESTER,"That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty see you"
GLOUCESTER,Bid me farewell.
GLOUCESTER,"Sirs, take up the corse."
GLOUCESTER,"No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
against me,
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If he were dead, what would betide of me?"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Oh, he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"It is determined, not concluded yet"
BUCKINGHAM,Good time of day unto your royal grace!
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What likelihood of his amendment, lords?"
BUCKINGHAM,"Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
BUCKINGHAM,"Madam, we did"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Would all were well! but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest."
GLOUCESTER,"They do me wrong, and I will not endure it"
GLOUCESTER,"To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in your outward actions shows itself
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it."
GLOUCESTER,I cannot tell
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends'"
GLOUCESTER,"Meantime, God grants that we have need of you"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"By Him that raised me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects."
GLOUCESTER,"You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment."
GLOUCESTER,"She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that"
GLOUCESTER,"What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs"
QUEEN MARGARET,"And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me."
GLOUCESTER,"What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Out, devil! I remember them too well"
GLOUCESTER,"Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Yea, and much better blood than his or thine."
GLOUCESTER,"In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am."
QUEEN MARGARET,"A murderous villain, and so still thou art."
GLOUCESTER,"Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--"
QUEEN MARGARET,Which God revenge!
GLOUCESTER,"To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
I am too childish-foolish for this world."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is."
GLOUCESTER,If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof."
QUEEN MARGARET,"A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, do not turn away!"
GLOUCESTER,"Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?"
QUEEN MARGARET,"But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That will I make before I let thee go."
GLOUCESTER,Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
QUEEN MARGARET,"I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance"
GLOUCESTER,"The curse my noble father laid on thee,
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So just is God, to right the innocent."
BUCKINGHAM,"Northumberland, then present, wept to see it."
QUEEN MARGARET,"What were you snarling all before I came,
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers"
GLOUCESTER,"Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!"
QUEEN MARGARET,"And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--"
GLOUCESTER,Margaret.
QUEEN MARGARET,Richard!
GLOUCESTER,Ha!
QUEEN MARGARET,I call thee not.
GLOUCESTER,"I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!"
GLOUCESTER,"'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
QUEEN MARGARET,"Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad."
QUEEN MARGARET,Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
QUEEN MARGARET,"To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Peace, master marquess, you are malapert"
GLOUCESTER,"Good counsel, marry"
GLOUCESTER,"Yea, and much more"
QUEEN MARGARET,"And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!"
BUCKINGHAM,"Have done! for shame, if not for charity."
QUEEN MARGARET,Urge neither charity nor shame to me
BUCKINGHAM,"Have done, have done."
QUEEN MARGARET,"O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
In sign of league and amity with thee"
BUCKINGHAM,"Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air."
QUEEN MARGARET,"I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death"
GLOUCESTER,"What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?"
BUCKINGHAM,"Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord."
QUEEN MARGARET,"What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day,
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!"
GLOUCESTER,I cannot blame her
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I never did her any, to my knowledge."
GLOUCESTER,"But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the cause of it!"
GLOUCESTER,So do I ever
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?"
GLOUCESTER,"I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey"
GLOUCESTER,"Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him."
GLOUCESTER,"Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears"
CLARENCE,"O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!"
CLARENCE,"Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches"
CLARENCE,"Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost"
CLARENCE,"O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd"
CLARENCE,"O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep."
CLARENCE,"Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine."
CLARENCE,"In God's name, what art thou?"
CLARENCE,"But not, as I am, royal."
CLARENCE,"Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble."
CLARENCE,"How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me"
CLARENCE,To murder me?
CLARENCE,"You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?"
CLARENCE,I shall be reconciled to him again.
CLARENCE,"Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake is damnable."
CLARENCE,"Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder"
CLARENCE,"Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake"
CLARENCE,"My brother's love, the devil, and my rage."
CLARENCE,"Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death."
CLARENCE,"O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear"
CLARENCE,"Tell him, when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship"
CLARENCE,"O, do not slander him, for he is kind."
CLARENCE,"It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would labour my delivery."
CLARENCE,"Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed."
CLARENCE,"Relent, and save your souls."
CLARENCE,"Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks"
KING EDWARD IV,"Why, so"
KING EDWARD IV,"Take heed you dally not before your king;
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you to be the other's end."
KING EDWARD IV,"Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factious one against the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeignedly."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!"
KING EDWARD IV,"Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess."
KING EDWARD IV,"Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
And make me happy in your unity."
BUCKINGHAM,"Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours,
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in zeal to yours."
KING EDWARD IV,"A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
To make the perfect period of this peace."
BUCKINGHAM,"And, in good time, here comes the noble duke."
GLOUCESTER,Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen
KING EDWARD IV,"Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
Brother, we done deeds of charity;
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers."
GLOUCESTER,"A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,A holy day shall this be kept hereafter
GLOUCESTER,"Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
To be so bouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
You do him injury to scorn his corse."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"All seeing heaven, what a world is this!"
BUCKINGHAM,"Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?"
KING EDWARD IV,Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
GLOUCESTER,"But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear"
KING EDWARD IV,"I pray thee, peace"
KING EDWARD IV,Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
KING EDWARD IV,"Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was cruel death.
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
And I unjustly too, must grant it you
But for my brother not a man would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence!"
GLOUCESTER,"This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
To comfort Edward with our company."
BUCKINGHAM,We wait upon your grace.
DUCHESS OF YORK,"No, boy."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
I do lament the sickness of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ay, boy."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my soul,
And to myself become an enemy."
DUCHESS OF YORK,What means this scene of rude impatience?
QUEEN ELIZABETH,To make an act of tragic violence
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
And lived by looking on his images"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
DUCHESS OF YORK,What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Was never widow had so dear a loss!
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she"
GLOUCESTER,"Madam, have comfort"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!"
GLOUCESTER,""
BUCKINGHAM,"You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's love
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept"
BUCKINGHAM,"Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
Which would be so much the more dangerous
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd"
GLOUCESTER,"I hope the king made peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and true in me."
GLOUCESTER,"Then be it so; and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
To give your censures in this weighty business?"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,With all our harts.
BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king."
GLOUCESTER,"My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind."
DUCHESS OF YORK,I long with all my heart to see the prince
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious."
DUCHESS OF YORK,I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
DUCHESS OF YORK,"How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,A parlous boy
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Pitchers have ears.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,How fares the prince?
DUCHESS OF YORK,What is thy news then?
DUCHESS OF YORK,Who hath committed them?
QUEEN ELIZABETH,For what offence?
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell."
DUCHESS OF YORK,I'll go along with you.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,You have no cause.
BUCKINGHAM,"Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber."
GLOUCESTER,"Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
The weary way hath made you melancholy."
GLOUCESTER,"Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts "
GLOUCESTER,"My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you."
BUCKINGHAM,"And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord."
BUCKINGHAM,"Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce."
BUCKINGHAM,"You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
And those who have the wit to claim the place"
GLOUCESTER,"Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower"
BUCKINGHAM,"He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified."
BUCKINGHAM,"Upon record, my gracious lord."
GLOUCESTER,""
GLOUCESTER,"I say, without characters, fame lives long.
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word."
BUCKINGHAM,"What, my gracious lord?"
GLOUCESTER,""
BUCKINGHAM,"Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York."
GLOUCESTER,"How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?"
GLOUCESTER,"He hath, my lord."
GLOUCESTER,"O, my fair cousin, I must not say so."
GLOUCESTER,"He may command me as my sovereign;
But you have power in me as in a kinsman."
GLOUCESTER,"My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart."
GLOUCESTER,A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
GLOUCESTER,"A gentle cousin, were it light enough."
GLOUCESTER,It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
GLOUCESTER,"What, would you have my weapon, little lord?"
GLOUCESTER,How?
BUCKINGHAM,"With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
He prettily and aptly taunts himself"
GLOUCESTER,"My lord, will't please you pass along?
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you."
GLOUCESTER,"Why, what should you fear?"
GLOUCESTER,"Nor none that live, I hope."
BUCKINGHAM,"Think you, my lord, this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?"
GLOUCESTER,"No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe."
BUCKINGHAM,"Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart"
BUCKINGHAM,"What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?"
BUCKINGHAM,"Well, then, no more but this"
GLOUCESTER,Commend me to Lord William
BUCKINGHAM,"Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly."
GLOUCESTER,"Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?"
GLOUCESTER,"At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both."
BUCKINGHAM,"Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?"
GLOUCESTER,"Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do"
BUCKINGHAM,I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
GLOUCESTER,"And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form."
BUCKINGHAM,"What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand."
BUCKINGHAM,"I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
I shall return before your lordship thence."
BUCKINGHAM,""
BUCKINGHAM,Are all things fitting for that royal time?
BUCKINGHAM,"Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Who is most inward with the royal duke?"
BUCKINGHAM,"Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love."
GLOUCESTER,"My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
Which by my presence might have been concluded."
BUCKINGHAM,"Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king."
GLOUCESTER,"Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well."
GLOUCESTER,My lord of Ely!
GLOUCESTER,"When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them."
GLOUCESTER,"Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
As he will lose his head ere give consent
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne."
BUCKINGHAM,"Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you."
GLOUCESTER,"I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Upon my body with their hellish charms?"
GLOUCESTER,Then be your eyes the witness of this ill
GLOUCESTER,"If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor"
GLOUCESTER,"Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
And then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?"
BUCKINGHAM,"Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Intending deep suspicion"
GLOUCESTER,"He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along."
BUCKINGHAM,"Lord mayor,--"
GLOUCESTER,Look to the drawbridge there!
BUCKINGHAM,Hark! a drum.
GLOUCESTER,"Catesby, o'erlook the walls."
BUCKINGHAM,"Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--"
GLOUCESTER,"Look back, defend thee, here are enemies."
BUCKINGHAM,God and our innocency defend and guard us!
GLOUCESTER,"Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel."
GLOUCESTER,"So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts"
BUCKINGHAM,"Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
That ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that, by great preservation,
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
This day had plotted, in the council-house
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?"
GLOUCESTER,"What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
Enforced us to this execution?"
GLOUCESTER,"Yet had not we determined he should die,
Until your lordship came to see his death;
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented"
GLOUCESTER,"And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
To avoid the carping censures of the world."
BUCKINGHAM,"But since you come too late of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend"
GLOUCESTER,"Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post"
BUCKINGHAM,"Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself"
GLOUCESTER,"If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops."
BUCKINGHAM,I go
GLOUCESTER,"Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
Now will I in, to take some privy order,
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
And to give notice, that no manner of person
At any time have recourse unto the princes."
GLOUCESTER,"How now, my lord, what say the citizens?"
BUCKINGHAM,"Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum and speak not a word."
GLOUCESTER,Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
BUCKINGHAM,"I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father then in France,
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right idea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility"
GLOUCESTER,Ah! and did they so?
BUCKINGHAM,"No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence"
GLOUCESTER,What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
BUCKINGHAM,"No, by my troth, my lord."
GLOUCESTER,Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
BUCKINGHAM,The mayor is here at hand
GLOUCESTER,"I go; and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue."
BUCKINGHAM,"Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
Here comes his servant"
BUCKINGHAM,"Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
In deep designs and matters of great moment,
No less importing than our general good,
Are come to have some conference with his grace."
BUCKINGHAM,"Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knees at meditation;
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
But meditating with two deep divines;
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul"
BUCKINGHAM,"I fear he will.
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?"
BUCKINGHAM,"Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him"
BUCKINGHAM,"Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
To stay him from the fall of vanity"
GLOUCESTER,"My lord, there needs no such apology"
BUCKINGHAM,"Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle."
GLOUCESTER,"I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance."
BUCKINGHAM,"You have, my lord"
GLOUCESTER,Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
BUCKINGHAM,"Then know, it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a blemished stock"
GLOUCESTER,"I know not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer, you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
So season'd with your faithful love to me.
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
First if all obstacles were cut away,
And that my path were even to the crown,
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
So mighty and so many my defects,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
Will well become the seat of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend that I should wring from him!"
BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstances well considered.
You say that Edward is your brother's son"
BUCKINGHAM,"Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love."
GLOUCESTER,"Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
I am unfit for state and majesty;
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I cannot nor I will not yield to you."
BUCKINGHAM,"If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have noted in you to your kin,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
But we will plant some other in the throne,
To the disgrace and downfall of your house"
GLOUCESTER,"O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham."
GLOUCESTER,"Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
I must have patience to endure the load"
GLOUCESTER,"In saying so, you shall but say the truth."
BUCKINGHAM,Then I salute you with this kingly title
BUCKINGHAM,To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
GLOUCESTER,"Even when you please, since you will have it so."
BUCKINGHAM,"To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace"
GLOUCESTER,"Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"As much to you, good sister! Whither away?"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Kind sister, thanks"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The king! why, who's that?"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?"
DUCHESS OF YORK,I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
With this dead-killing news!"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!"
DUCHESS OF YORK,""
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
For tender princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell."
KING RICHARD III,Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
BUCKINGHAM,My gracious sovereign?
KING RICHARD III,"Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
But shall we wear these honours for a day?
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?"
BUCKINGHAM,Still live they and for ever may they last!
KING RICHARD III,"O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be current gold indeed
Young Edward lives"
BUCKINGHAM,"Say on, my loving lord."
KING RICHARD III,"Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,"
BUCKINGHAM,"Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege."
KING RICHARD III,Ha! am I king? 'tis so
BUCKINGHAM,"True, noble prince."
KING RICHARD III,"O bitter consequence,
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull"
BUCKINGHAM,Your grace may do your pleasure.
KING RICHARD III,"Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth"
BUCKINGHAM,"Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
Before I positively herein"
KING RICHARD III,"I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys"
KING RICHARD III,"Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?"
KING RICHARD III,What is his name?
KING RICHARD III,I partly know the man
KING RICHARD III,Catesby!
KING RICHARD III,"Rumour it abroad
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die"
KING RICHARD III,"Art thou, indeed?"
KING RICHARD III,Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
KING RICHARD III,"Why, there thou hast it"
KING RICHARD III,"Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
Go, by this token"
KING RICHARD III,"Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?"
BUCKINGHAM,"My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
The late demand that you did sound me in."
KING RICHARD III,"Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond."
BUCKINGHAM,"I hear that news, my lord."
KING RICHARD III,"Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it."
BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
The which you promised I should possess."
KING RICHARD III,"Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it."
BUCKINGHAM,What says your highness to my just demand?
KING RICHARD III,"As I remember, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--"
BUCKINGHAM,My lord!
KING RICHARD III,"How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?"
BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, your promise for the earldom,--"
KING RICHARD III,"Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
And call'd it Rougemont"
BUCKINGHAM,My Lord!
KING RICHARD III,"Ay, what's o'clock?"
BUCKINGHAM,"I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promised me."
KING RICHARD III,"Well, but what's o'clock?"
BUCKINGHAM,Upon the stroke of ten.
KING RICHARD III,"Well, let it strike."
BUCKINGHAM,Why let it strike?
KING RICHARD III,"Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to-day."
BUCKINGHAM,"Why, then resolve me whether you will or no."
KING RICHARD III,"Tut, tut,
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein."
BUCKINGHAM,"Is it even so? rewards he my true service
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!"
KING RICHARD III,"Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?"
KING RICHARD III,But didst thou see them dead?
KING RICHARD III,"And buried, gentle Tyrrel?"
KING RICHARD III,"Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
And be inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till soon.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer."
KING RICHARD III,"Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?"
KING RICHARD III,"Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men"
QUEEN MARGARET,"So, now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mother's lamentation!"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Hover about her; say, that right for right
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"So many miseries have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?"
QUEEN MARGARET,"When holy Harry died, and my sweet son."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?"
QUEEN MARGARET,"If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!"
QUEEN MARGARET,"I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of but what I was;
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this, and see what now thou art"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine."
DUCHESS OF YORK,Why should calamity be full of words?
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have scope"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"If so, then be not tongue-tied"
KING RICHARD III,Who intercepts my expedition?
DUCHESS OF YORK,"O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Where should be graven, if that right were right,
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?"
KING RICHARD III,"A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's enointed"
DUCHESS OF YORK,Art thou my son?
KING RICHARD III,"Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself."
DUCHESS OF YORK,Then patiently hear my impatience.
KING RICHARD III,"Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"O, let me speak!"
KING RICHARD III,Do then
DUCHESS OF YORK,I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
KING RICHARD III,"And brief, good mother; for I am in haste."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony."
KING RICHARD III,And came I not at last to comfort you?
DUCHESS OF YORK,"No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred"
KING RICHARD III,"Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
Strike the drum."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"I prithee, hear me speak."
KING RICHARD III,You speak too bitterly.
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Hear me a word;
For I shall never speak to thee again."
KING RICHARD III,So.
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face again.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And there the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me; I say amen to all."
KING RICHARD III,"Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to murder"
KING RICHARD III,"You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And must she die for this? O, let her live,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy"
KING RICHARD III,"Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To save her life, I'll say she is not so."
KING RICHARD III,Her life is only safest in her birth.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,And only in that safety died her brothers.
KING RICHARD III,"Lo, at their births good stars were opposite."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"No, to their lives bad friends were contrary."
KING RICHARD III,All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"True, when avoided grace makes destiny"
KING RICHARD III,You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction"
KING RICHARD III,"Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend more good to you and yours,
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
To be discover'd, that can do me good?"
KING RICHARD III,"The advancement of your children, gentle lady."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?"
KING RICHARD III,"No, to the dignity and height of honour
The high imperial type of this earth's glory."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?"
KING RICHARD III,"Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date."
KING RICHARD III,"Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
KING RICHARD III,What do you think?
QUEEN ELIZABETH,That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
KING RICHARD III,Be not so hasty to confound my meaning
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?"
KING RICHARD III,Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What, thou?"
KING RICHARD III,"I, even I"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,How canst thou woo her?
KING RICHARD III,"That would I learn of you,
As one that are best acquainted with her humour."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,And wilt thou learn of me?
KING RICHARD III,"Madam, with all my heart."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
Edward and York; then haply she will weep"
KING RICHARD III,"Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
To win our daughter."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"There is no other way
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
And not be Richard that hath done all this."
KING RICHARD III,Say that I did all this for love of her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil."
KING RICHARD III,"Look, what is done cannot be now amended"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What were I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Under what title shall I woo for thee,
That God, the law, my honour and her love,
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?"
KING RICHARD III,Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
KING RICHARD III,"Say that the king, which may command, entreats."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
KING RICHARD III,"Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To wail the tide, as her mother doth."
KING RICHARD III,"Say, I will love her everlastingly."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
KING RICHARD III,Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
KING RICHARD III,So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
KING RICHARD III,"Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty."
KING RICHARD III,Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
KING RICHARD III,Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
KING RICHARD III,Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave."
KING RICHARD III,"Harp not on that string, madam; that is past."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
KING RICHARD III,"Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd."
KING RICHARD III,I swear--
QUEEN ELIZABETH,By nothing; for this is no oath
KING RICHARD III,"Now, by the world--"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
KING RICHARD III,My father's death--
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
KING RICHARD III,"Then, by myself--"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Thyself thyself misusest.
KING RICHARD III,"Why then, by God--"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"God's wrong is most of all.
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother made
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain"
KING RICHARD III,The time to come.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
The children live, whose parents thou hast
slaughter'd,
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast."
KING RICHARD III,"As I intend to prosper and repent,
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
In her consists my happiness and thine;
Without her, follows to this land and me,
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
KING RICHARD III,"Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Shall I forget myself to be myself?
KING RICHARD III,"Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,But thou didst kill my children.
KING RICHARD III,But in your daughter's womb I bury them
QUEEN ELIZABETH,Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
KING RICHARD III,And be a happy mother by the deed.
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I go. Write to me very shortly.
And you shall understand from me her mind."
KING RICHARD III,"Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
How now! what news?"
KING RICHARD III,Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk
KING RICHARD III,Fly to the duke
KING RICHARD III,"O, true, good Catesby"
KING RICHARD III,"Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?"
KING RICHARD III,"My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
How now, what news with you?"
KING RICHARD III,"Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
Once more, what news?"
KING RICHARD III,"There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?"
KING RICHARD III,"Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?"
KING RICHARD III,"Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?"
KING RICHARD III,"Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear."
KING RICHARD III,"Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore.
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!"
KING RICHARD III,Cold friends to Richard
KING RICHARD III,"Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond"
KING RICHARD III,"Well,
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George Stanley"
KING RICHARD III,"Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
Take that, until thou bring me better news."
KING RICHARD III,I cry thee mercy
KING RICHARD III,"March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home."
KING RICHARD III,"Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
A royal battle might be won and lost
Some one take order Buckingham be brought
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me."
BUCKINGHAM,Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
BUCKINGHAM,"Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
If that your moody discontented souls
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
Even for revenge mock my destruction!
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?"
BUCKINGHAM,"Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
False to his children or his wife's allies
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs"
KING RICHARD III,"Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?"
KING RICHARD III,"My Lord of Norfolk,--"
KING RICHARD III,"Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?"
KING RICHARD III,"Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the foe?"
KING RICHARD III,"Why, our battalion trebles that account"
KING RICHARD III,What is't o'clock?
KING RICHARD III,"I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armour laid into my tent?"
KING RICHARD III,"Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels."
KING RICHARD III,"Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk."
KING RICHARD III,Catesby!
KING RICHARD III,"Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!"
KING RICHARD III,Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
KING RICHARD III,"So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine"
KING RICHARD III,"Bid my guard watch; leave me.
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say."
KING RICHARD III,Give me another horse
KING RICHARD III,'Zounds! who is there?
KING RICHARD III,"O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?"
KING RICHARD III,"O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--"
KING RICHARD III,"By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if any mean to shrink from me."
KING RICHARD III,What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
KING RICHARD III,He said the truth
KING RICHARD III,"He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun to-day?"
KING RICHARD III,"Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!"
KING RICHARD III,"The sun will not be seen to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him."
KING RICHARD III,"Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power"
KING RICHARD III,""
KING RICHARD III,Off with his son George's head!
KING RICHARD III,A thousand hearts are great within my bosom
KING RICHARD III,A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
KING RICHARD III,"Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die"
KING RICHARD II,"Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?"
KING RICHARD II,"Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known ground of treachery in him?"
KING RICHARD II,"Then call them to our presence; face to face,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Many years of happy days befal
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!"
KING RICHARD II,We thank you both
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"First, heaven be the record to my speech!
In the devotion of a subject's love,
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
And free from other misbegotten hate,
Come I appellant to this princely presence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
My body shall make good upon this earth,
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop"
KING RICHARD II,"What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
Besides I say and will in battle prove,
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
That ever was survey'd by English eye,
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good,
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood"
KING RICHARD II,"How high a pitch his resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?"
KING RICHARD II,"Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears"
KING RICHARD II,"Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
Let's purge this choler without letting blood"
KING RICHARD II,"And, Norfolk, throw down his."
KING RICHARD II,"Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot."
KING RICHARD II,Rage must be withstood
KING RICHARD II,"Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face."
KING RICHARD II,"We were not born to sue, but to command;
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day"
KING RICHARD II,"Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms"
KING RICHARD II,"Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war,
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him in the justice of his cause."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
And bow my knee before his majesty"
KING RICHARD II,"We will descend and fold him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
KING RICHARD II,"Farewell, my lord"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen."
KING RICHARD II,"Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
And both return back to their chairs again"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Your will be done
KING RICHARD II,"Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce"
KING RICHARD II,It boots thee not to be compassionate
KING RICHARD II,"Return again, and take an oath with thee.
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
To keep the oath that we administer"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,I swear.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy"
KING RICHARD II,"Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"How long a time lies in one little word!
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word"
KING RICHARD II,"Why uncle, thou hast many years to live."
KING RICHARD II,"Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave"
KING RICHARD II,"Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I have too few to take my leave of you,
When the tongue's office should be prodigal
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Joy absent, grief is present for that time."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in the end,
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
But that I was a journeyman to grief?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O, who can hold a fire in his hand
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
O, no! the apprehension of the good
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman."
KING RICHARD II,"We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?"
KING RICHARD II,"And say, what store of parting tears were shed?"
KING RICHARD II,What said our cousin when you parted with him?
KING RICHARD II,"He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
When time shall call him home from banishment,
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his courtship to the common people;
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy,
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune,
As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee,
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
As were our England in reversion his,
And he our subjects' next degree in hope."
KING RICHARD II,We will ourself in person to this war
KING RICHARD II,Where lies he?
KING RICHARD II,"Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
To help him to his grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him"
KING RICHARD II,"What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?"
KING RICHARD II,Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
KING RICHARD II,Should dying men flatter with those that live?
KING RICHARD II,"Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me."
KING RICHARD II,"I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill."
KING RICHARD II,"A lunatic lean-witted fool,
Presuming on an ague's privilege,
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
With fury from his native residence.
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders."
KING RICHARD II,"And let them die that age and sullens have;
For both hast thou, and both become the grave."
KING RICHARD II,"Right, you say true"
KING RICHARD II,What says he?
KING RICHARD II,"The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars"
KING RICHARD II,"Why, uncle, what's the matter?"
KING RICHARD II,"Think what you will, we seize into our hands
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands."
KING RICHARD II,"Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of much less value is my company
Than your good words. But who comes here?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
I count myself in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends;
And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
It shall be still thy true love's recompense"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
A banish'd traitor"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
And I am come to seek that name in England;
And I must find that title in your tongue,
Before I make reply to aught you say."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I shall not need transport my words by you;
Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,My gracious uncle--
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious uncle, let me know my fault"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"An offer, uncle, that we will accept"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Bring forth these men.
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
With too much urging your pernicious lives,
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
From off my hands, here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
By you unhappied and disfigured clean"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
To fight with Glendower and his complices"
KING RICHARD II,Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
KING RICHARD II,Needs must I like it well
KING RICHARD II,"Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole,
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
Not able to endure the sight of day,
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord"
KING RICHARD II,"But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
And, till so much blood thither come again,
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
For time hath set a blot upon my pride."
KING RICHARD II,"I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
Ye favourites of a king"
KING RICHARD II,"Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
And what loss is it to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so"
KING RICHARD II,"Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it"
KING RICHARD II,"O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!"
KING RICHARD II,No matter where; of comfort no man speak
KING RICHARD II,Thou chidest me well
KING RICHARD II,"Thou hast said enough.
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
What say you now? what comfort have we now?
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
That bids me be of comfort any more.
Go to Flint castle"
KING RICHARD II,"He does me double wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
Discharge my followers"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
With some few private friends upon this coast."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Mistake not, uncle, further than you should."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Against their will. But who comes here?
Welcome, Harry"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Royally!
Why, it contains no king?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Noble lords,
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver"
KING RICHARD II,"We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king"
KING RICHARD II,"Northumberland, say thus the king returns"
KING RICHARD II,"O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
That laid the sentence of dread banishment
On yon proud man, should take it off again
With words of sooth! O that I were as great
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
Or that I could forget what I have been,
Or not remember what I must be now!
Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me."
KING RICHARD II,"What must the king do now? must he submit?
The king shall do it"
KING RICHARD II,"Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,What says his majesty?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Stand all apart,
And show fair duty to his majesty.
My gracious lord,--"
KING RICHARD II,"Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
To make the base earth proud with kissing it"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious lord, I come but for mine own."
KING RICHARD II,"Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
As my true service shall deserve your love."
KING RICHARD II,Well you deserve
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Yea, my good lord."
KING RICHARD II,Then I must not say no.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Call forth Bagot.
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
The bloody office of his timeless end."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"These differences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your days of trial."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
He may surrender; so we shall proceed
Without suspicion."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
Little are we beholding to your love,
And little look'd for at your helping hands."
KING RICHARD II,"Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs"
KING RICHARD II,"Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
Here cousin"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,I thought you had been willing to resign.
KING RICHARD II,My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
KING RICHARD II,"Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by new care won"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Are you contented to resign the crown?
KING RICHARD II,"Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
I give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
With mine own hands I give away my crown,
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
With mine own breath release all duty's rites"
KING RICHARD II,"Must I do so? and must I ravel out
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
If thy offences were upon record,
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
Containing the deposing of a king
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven"
KING RICHARD II,"Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see"
KING RICHARD II,"No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
No, not that name was given me at the font,
But 'tis usurp'd"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
KING RICHARD II,"Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland."
KING RICHARD II,They shall be satisfied
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
The shadow or your face."
KING RICHARD II,"Say that again.
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Name it, fair cousin."
KING RICHARD II,'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Yet ask.
KING RICHARD II,And shall I have?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,You shall.
KING RICHARD II,Then give me leave to go.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Whither?
KING RICHARD II,"Whither you will, so I were from your sights."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Go, some of you convey him to the Tower."
KING RICHARD II,"O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation"
KING RICHARD II,"Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
To make my end too sudden"
KING RICHARD II,"A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
I had been still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France"
KING RICHARD II,"Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
The time shall not be many hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
Shalt break into corruption"
KING RICHARD II,"Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
And then betwixt me and my married wife.
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
My wife to France"
KING RICHARD II,"Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart."
KING RICHARD II,"So two, together weeping, make one woe.
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans."
KING RICHARD II,"Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart."
KING RICHARD II,We make woe wanton with this fond delay
DUCHESS OF YORK,"My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
When weeping made you break the story off,
of our two cousins coming into London."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"At that sad stop, my lord,
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?"
DUCHESS OF YORK,Here comes my son Aumerle.
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Welcome, my son"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"What should you fear?
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"What is the matter, my lord?"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Why, what is it, my lord?"
DUCHESS OF YORK,What is the matter?
DUCHESS OF YORK,"I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle."
DUCHESS OF YORK,Thy life answer!
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
Hence, villain! never more come in my sight."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"He shall be none;
We'll keep him here"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Hadst thou groan'd for him
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
And that he is a bastard, not thy son"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Spur post, and get before him to the king,
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
I would to God, my lords, he might be found"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And what said the gallant?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What means our cousin, that he stares and looks
So wildly?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
What is the matter with our cousin now?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Intended or committed was this fault?
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
To win thy after-love I pardon thee."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Have thy desire.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Villain, I'll make thee safe."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What is the matter, uncle? speak;
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
That we may arm us to encounter it."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
O loyal father of a treacherous son!
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
This deadly blot in thy digressing son."
DUCHESS OF YORK,""
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?
DUCHESS OF YORK,"A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
Love loving not itself none other can."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Rise up, good aunt."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Not yet, I thee beseech"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Good aunt, stand up."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
That set'st the word itself against the word!
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chopping French we do not understand.
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Good aunt, stand up."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"I do not sue to stand;
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I pardon him, as God shall pardon me."
DUCHESS OF YORK,"O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With all my heart
I pardon him."
DUCHESS OF YORK,A god on earth thou art.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
With all the rest of that consorted crew,
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
Good uncle, help to order several powers
To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are"
DUCHESS OF YORK,"Come, my old son"
KING RICHARD II,"I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world"
KING RICHARD II,"Thanks, noble peer;
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
Where no man never comes but that sad dog
That brings me food to make misfortune live?"
KING RICHARD II,"Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
How went he under him?"
KING RICHARD II,"So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
Since thou, created to be awed by man,
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke."
KING RICHARD II,"If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away."
KING RICHARD II,"Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do."
KING RICHARD II,"The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it."
KING RICHARD II,"How now! what means death in this rude assault?
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome, my lord what is the news?"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Carlisle, this is your doom"
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land."
HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"They love not poison that do poison need,
Nor do I thee"
BENVOLIO,"Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do."
BENVOLIO,I do but keep the peace
BENVOLIO,"Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach"
BENVOLIO,"Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son"
BENVOLIO,"My noble uncle, do you know the cause?"
BENVOLIO,Have you importuned him by any means?
BENVOLIO,"See, where he comes"
BENVOLIO,"Good-morrow, cousin."
ROMEO,Is the day so young?
BENVOLIO,But new struck nine.
ROMEO,"Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
BENVOLIO,It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
ROMEO,"Not having that, which, having, makes them short."
BENVOLIO,In love?
ROMEO,Out--
BENVOLIO,Of love?
ROMEO,"Out of her favour, where I am in love."
BENVOLIO,"Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!"
ROMEO,"Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?"
BENVOLIO,"No, coz, I rather weep."
ROMEO,"Good heart, at what?"
BENVOLIO,At thy good heart's oppression.
ROMEO,"Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine"
BENVOLIO,"Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong."
ROMEO,"Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where."
BENVOLIO,"Tell me in sadness, who is that you love."
ROMEO,"What, shall I groan and tell thee?"
BENVOLIO,"Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who."
ROMEO,Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
BENVOLIO,"I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved."
ROMEO,A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
BENVOLIO,"A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit."
ROMEO,"Well, in that hit you miss"
BENVOLIO,Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROMEO,"She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair"
BENVOLIO,"Be ruled by me, forget to think of her."
ROMEO,"O, teach me how I should forget to think."
BENVOLIO,"By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties."
ROMEO,"'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more"
BENVOLIO,"I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt."
BENVOLIO,"Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish"
ROMEO,Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
BENVOLIO,"For what, I pray thee?"
ROMEO,For your broken shin.
BENVOLIO,"Why, Romeo, art thou mad?"
ROMEO,"Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow."
ROMEO,"Ay, mine own fortune in my misery."
ROMEO,"Ay, if I know the letters and the language."
ROMEO,"Stay, fellow; I can read.
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly"
ROMEO,Whither?
ROMEO,Whose house?
ROMEO,"Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before."
BENVOLIO,"At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona"
ROMEO,"When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun."
BENVOLIO,"Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye"
ROMEO,"I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own."
Nurse,"Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!"
JULIET,How now! who calls?
Nurse,Your mother.
JULIET,"Madam, I am here.
What is your will?"
Nurse,"Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour."
Nurse,"I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?"
Nurse,"Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age"
Nurse,"Yes, madam"
JULIET,"And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I."
Nurse,"Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed"
JULIET,It is an honour that I dream not of.
Nurse,"An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat."
Nurse,"A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax."
Nurse,"Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower."
Nurse,"No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men."
JULIET,"I'll look to like, if looking liking move"
Nurse,"Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days."
ROMEO,"What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?"
BENVOLIO,The date is out of such prolixity
ROMEO,Give me a torch
MERCUTIO,"Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance."
ROMEO,"Not I, believe me"
MERCUTIO,"You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound."
ROMEO,"I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe"
MERCUTIO,"And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing."
ROMEO,"Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn."
MERCUTIO,"If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in"
BENVOLIO,"Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs."
ROMEO,A torch for me
MERCUTIO,"Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word"
ROMEO,"Nay, that's not so."
MERCUTIO,"I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits."
ROMEO,"And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go."
MERCUTIO,"Why, may one ask?"
ROMEO,I dream'd a dream to-night.
MERCUTIO,And so did I.
ROMEO,"Well, what was yours?"
MERCUTIO,That dreamers often lie.
ROMEO,"In bed asleep, while they do dream things true."
MERCUTIO,"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are"
ROMEO,"Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing."
MERCUTIO,"True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south."
BENVOLIO,"This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late."
ROMEO,"I fear, too early"
BENVOLIO,"Strike, drum."
ROMEO,""
ROMEO,"O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night."
ROMEO,""
JULIET,"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss."
ROMEO,"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
JULIET,"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
ROMEO,"O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
JULIET,"Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake."
ROMEO,"Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged."
JULIET,Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROMEO,"Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again."
JULIET,You kiss by the book.
Nurse,"Madam, your mother craves a word with you."
ROMEO,What is her mother?
Nurse,"Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks."
ROMEO,"Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt."
BENVOLIO,"Away, begone; the sport is at the best."
ROMEO,"Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest."
JULIET,"Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?"
Nurse,The son and heir of old Tiberio.
JULIET,What's he that now is going out of door?
Nurse,"Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio."
JULIET,"What's he that follows there, that would not dance?"
Nurse,I know not.
JULIET,Go ask his name
Nurse,"His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy."
JULIET,"My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy."
Nurse,What's this? what's this?
JULIET,"A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal."
Nurse,"Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone."
ROMEO,"Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out."
BENVOLIO,Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
MERCUTIO,"He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed."
BENVOLIO,"He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall"
MERCUTIO,"Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh"
BENVOLIO,"And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him."
MERCUTIO,This cannot anger him
BENVOLIO,"Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night"
MERCUTIO,"If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night"
BENVOLIO,"Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found."
ROMEO,"He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she"
JULIET,Ay me!
ROMEO,She speaks
JULIET,"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet."
ROMEO,""
JULIET,"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself."
ROMEO,I take thee at thy word
JULIET,"What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?"
ROMEO,"By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am"
JULIET,"My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound"
ROMEO,"Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike."
JULIET,"How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here."
ROMEO,"With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me."
JULIET,"If they do see thee, they will murder thee."
ROMEO,"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords"
JULIET,I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROMEO,"I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here"
JULIET,By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
ROMEO,"By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise."
JULIET,"Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke"
ROMEO,"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--"
JULIET,"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable."
ROMEO,What shall I swear by?
JULIET,"Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee."
ROMEO,If my heart's dear love--
JULIET,"Well, do not swear"
ROMEO,"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
JULIET,What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
ROMEO,The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JULIET,I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
ROMEO,"Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?"
JULIET,"But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have"
ROMEO,"O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial."
JULIET,"Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
Nurse,""
JULIET,"I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--"
Nurse,""
JULIET,"By and by, I come"
ROMEO,So thrive my soul--
JULIET,A thousand times good night!
ROMEO,"A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks."
JULIET,"Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name."
ROMEO,It is my soul that calls upon my name
JULIET,Romeo!
ROMEO,My dear?
JULIET,"At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?"
ROMEO,At the hour of nine.
JULIET,I will not fail
ROMEO,Let me stand here till thou remember it.
JULIET,"I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company."
ROMEO,"And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this."
JULIET,'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone
ROMEO,I would I were thy bird.
JULIET,"Sweet, so would I"
ROMEO,"Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell."
ROMEO,"Good morrow, father."
ROMEO,That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
ROMEO,"With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe."
ROMEO,"I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded"
ROMEO,"Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet"
ROMEO,Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
ROMEO,And bad'st me bury love.
ROMEO,"I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so."
ROMEO,"O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste."
MERCUTIO,"Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?"
BENVOLIO,Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
MERCUTIO,"Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad."
BENVOLIO,"Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house."
MERCUTIO,"A challenge, on my life."
BENVOLIO,Romeo will answer it.
MERCUTIO,Any man that can write may answer a letter.
BENVOLIO,"Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared."
MERCUTIO,"Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft"
BENVOLIO,"Why, what is Tybalt?"
MERCUTIO,"More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom"
BENVOLIO,The what?
MERCUTIO,"The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!"
BENVOLIO,"Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo."
MERCUTIO,"Without his roe, like a dried herring"
ROMEO,Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTIO,"The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?"
ROMEO,"Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy."
MERCUTIO,"That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams."
ROMEO,"Meaning, to court'sy."
MERCUTIO,Thou hast most kindly hit it.
ROMEO,A most courteous exposition.
MERCUTIO,"Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy."
ROMEO,Pink for flower.
MERCUTIO,Right.
ROMEO,"Why, then is my pump well flowered."
MERCUTIO,Well said
ROMEO,"O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness."
MERCUTIO,"Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint."
ROMEO,"Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match."
MERCUTIO,"Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five"
ROMEO,"Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose."
MERCUTIO,I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
ROMEO,"Nay, good goose, bite not."
MERCUTIO,"Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce."
ROMEO,And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
MERCUTIO,"O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!"
ROMEO,"I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose."
MERCUTIO,"Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature"
BENVOLIO,"Stop there, stop there."
MERCUTIO,Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
BENVOLIO,Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
MERCUTIO,"O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short"
ROMEO,Here's goodly gear!
MERCUTIO,"A sail, a sail!"
BENVOLIO,"Two, two; a shirt and a smock."
Nurse,Peter!
Nurse,"My fan, Peter."
MERCUTIO,"Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
fairer face."
Nurse,"God ye good morrow, gentlemen."
MERCUTIO,"God ye good den, fair gentlewoman."
Nurse,Is it good den?
MERCUTIO,"'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon."
Nurse,Out upon you! what a man are you!
ROMEO,"One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
mar."
Nurse,"By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo?"
ROMEO,"I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
you have found him than he was when you sought him"
Nurse,You say well.
MERCUTIO,"Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely."
Nurse,"if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
you."
BENVOLIO,She will indite him to some supper.
MERCUTIO,"A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!"
ROMEO,What hast thou found?
MERCUTIO,"No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither."
ROMEO,I will follow you.
MERCUTIO,"Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
'lady, lady, lady.'"
Nurse,"Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?"
ROMEO,"A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month."
Nurse,"An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?"
Nurse,"Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word"
ROMEO,"Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee--"
Nurse,"Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much"
ROMEO,"What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me."
Nurse,"I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer."
ROMEO,"Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains."
Nurse,No truly sir; not a penny.
ROMEO,Go to; I say you shall.
Nurse,"This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there."
ROMEO,"And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall"
Nurse,"Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir."
ROMEO,"What say'st thou, my dear nurse?"
Nurse,"Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?"
ROMEO,"I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel."
ROMEO,"Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R."
Nurse,"Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
the--No; I know it begins with some other
letter"
ROMEO,Commend me to thy lady.
Nurse,"Ay, a thousand times.
Peter!"
Nurse,"Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace."
JULIET,"The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him"
Nurse,"Peter, stay at the gate."
JULIET,"Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face."
Nurse,"I am a-weary, give me leave awhile"
JULIET,"I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news"
Nurse,"Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?"
JULIET,"How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance"
Nurse,"Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
how to choose a man"
JULIET,"No, no"
Nurse,"Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!"
JULIET,"I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?"
Nurse,"Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?"
JULIET,"Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'"
Nurse,"O God's lady dear!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself."
JULIET,"Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?"
Nurse,Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
JULIET,I have.
Nurse,"Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife"
JULIET,"Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell."
ROMEO,"Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight"
JULIET,Good even to my ghostly confessor.
JULIET,"As much to him, else is his thanks too much."
ROMEO,"Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter."
JULIET,"Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament"
BENVOLIO,"I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire"
MERCUTIO,"Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need."
BENVOLIO,Am I like such a fellow?
MERCUTIO,"Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved."
BENVOLIO,And what to?
MERCUTIO,"Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast"
BENVOLIO,"An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter."
MERCUTIO,The fee-simple! O simple!
BENVOLIO,"By my head, here come the Capulets."
MERCUTIO,"By my heel, I care not."
MERCUTIO,"And but one word with one of us? couple it with
something; make it a word and a blow."
MERCUTIO,Could you not take some occasion without giving?
MERCUTIO,"Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords"
BENVOLIO,We talk here in the public haunt of men
MERCUTIO,"Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I."
MERCUTIO,"But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery"
ROMEO,"Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting"
ROMEO,"I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love"
MERCUTIO,"O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?"
MERCUTIO,"Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out."
ROMEO,"Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up."
MERCUTIO,"Come, sir, your passado."
ROMEO,"Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets"
MERCUTIO,"I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?"
BENVOLIO,"What, art thou hurt?"
MERCUTIO,"Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon."
ROMEO,"Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much."
MERCUTIO,"No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve"
ROMEO,I thought all for the best.
MERCUTIO,"Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me"
ROMEO,"This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!"
BENVOLIO,"O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth."
ROMEO,"This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must end."
BENVOLIO,Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
ROMEO,"Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company"
ROMEO,This shall determine that.
BENVOLIO,"Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed"
ROMEO,"O, I am fortune's fool!"
BENVOLIO,Why dost thou stay?
BENVOLIO,There lies that Tybalt.
BENVOLIO,"O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl"
BENVOLIO,"Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure"
JULIET,"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging"
Nurse,"Ay, ay, the cords."
JULIET,Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
Nurse,"Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!"
JULIET,Can heaven be so envious?
Nurse,"Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot"
JULIET,"What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice"
Nurse,"I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast"
JULIET,"O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!"
Nurse,"O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!"
JULIET,"What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?"
Nurse,"Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished."
JULIET,O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
Nurse,"It did, it did; alas the day, it did!"
JULIET,"O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!"
Nurse,"There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae"
JULIET,"Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame"
Nurse,Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
JULIET,"Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband"
Nurse,Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse
JULIET,Wash they his wounds with tears
Nurse,Hie to your chamber
JULIET,"O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell."
ROMEO,"Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?"
ROMEO,What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
ROMEO,"Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death"
ROMEO,"There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death"
ROMEO,"'Tis torture, and not mercy"
ROMEO,"O, thou wilt speak again of banishment."
ROMEO,"Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not"
ROMEO,"How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?"
ROMEO,Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
ROMEO,"Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes."
Nurse,""
Nurse,"O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?"
Nurse,"O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man"
ROMEO,Nurse!
Nurse,"Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all."
ROMEO,"Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?"
Nurse,"O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again."
ROMEO,"As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion."
Nurse,"O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
To hear good counsel"
ROMEO,"Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide."
Nurse,"Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir"
ROMEO,How well my comfort is revived by this!
ROMEO,"But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee"
JULIET,Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day
ROMEO,"It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale"
JULIET,"Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I"
ROMEO,"Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads"
JULIET,"It is, it is"
ROMEO,More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
Nurse,Madam!
JULIET,Nurse?
Nurse,Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
JULIET,"Then, window, let day in, and let life out."
ROMEO,"Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend."
JULIET,"Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days"
ROMEO,"Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee."
JULIET,O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
ROMEO,"I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come."
JULIET,"O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb"
ROMEO,"And trust me, love, in my eye so do you"
JULIET,"O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle"
JULIET,"Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?"
JULIET,"Madam, I am not well."
JULIET,Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
JULIET,"Feeling so the loss,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend."
JULIET,What villain madam?
JULIET,""
JULIET,"Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands"
JULIET,"Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!"
JULIET,And joy comes well in such a needy time
JULIET,"Madam, in happy time, what day is that?"
JULIET,"Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!"
JULIET,"Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have"
JULIET,"Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word."
Nurse,"God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so."
Nurse,I speak no treason.
Nurse,May not one speak?
JULIET,"Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies."
JULIET,"O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse."
Nurse,"Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him"
JULIET,Speakest thou from thy heart?
Nurse,"And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both."
JULIET,Amen!
Nurse,What?
JULIET,"Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in"
Nurse,"Marry, I will; and this is wisely done."
JULIET,"Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy"
JULIET,"That may be, sir, when I may be a wife."
JULIET,What must be shall be.
JULIET,"To answer that, I should confess to you."
JULIET,I will confess to you that I love him.
JULIET,"If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face."
JULIET,"The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite."
JULIET,"That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face."
JULIET,"It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?"
JULIET,"O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!"
JULIET,"Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it"
JULIET,"O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love."
JULIET,"Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!"
JULIET,"Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!"
Nurse,"Ay, forsooth."
Nurse,See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
JULIET,"Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon"
JULIET,"I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty."
JULIET,"Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?"
JULIET,"Ay, those attires are best"
JULIET,"No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow"
JULIET,"Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life"
Nurse,They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Nurse,"Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching."
Nurse,"Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she"
Nurse,O lamentable day!
Nurse,"Look, look! O heavy day!"
Nurse,"She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!"
Nurse,O lamentable day!
Nurse,"O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this"
Nurse,"Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case."
ROMEO,"If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand"
ROMEO,"Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging"
ROMEO,"Tush, thou art deceived"
ROMEO,No matter
ROMEO,"Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor"
ROMEO,"Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this."
ROMEO,"I pay thy poverty, and not thy will."
ROMEO,"There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell"
ROMEO,"Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light"
ROMEO,So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that
ROMEO,"Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!"
ROMEO,"I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave me"
ROMEO,"Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!"
ROMEO,"In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet"
JULIET,"O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?"
JULIET,"Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end"
JULIET,"Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
This is thy sheath;
there rust, and let me die."
WARWICK,I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
WARWICK,"And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This is the palace of the fearful king,
And this the regal seat"
WARWICK,"And when the king comes, offer no violence,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce."
WARWICK,"The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
Hath made us by-words to our enemies."
WARWICK,"Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares"
KING HENRY VI,"My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
Even in the chair of state"
KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland."
KING HENRY VI,"Ah, know you not the city favours them,
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?"
KING HENRY VI,"Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign."
WARWICK,"Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry."
WARWICK,"True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York."
KING HENRY VI,"And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?"
WARWICK,Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
WARWICK,"And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
March'd through the city to the palace gates."
WARWICK,Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
KING HENRY VI,"What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March"
WARWICK,"Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all."
KING HENRY VI,"The lord protector lost it, and not I"
KING HENRY VI,"Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak."
WARWICK,Plantagenet shall speak first
KING HENRY VI,"Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
No"
WARWICK,"Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king."
KING HENRY VI,Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
KING HENRY VI,""
KING HENRY VI,"An if he may, then am I lawful king;
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father was, and I am his."
WARWICK,"Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?"
KING HENRY VI,"Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?"
KING HENRY VI,""
WARWICK,"Deposed he shall be, in despite of all."
KING HENRY VI,"O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!"
WARWICK,"Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurping blood."
KING HENRY VI,"My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word"
KING HENRY VI,I am content
WARWICK,What good is this to England and himself!
WARWICK,"Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not."
KING HENRY VI,"Ah, Exeter!"
WARWICK,"Why should you sigh, my lord?"
KING HENRY VI,"Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it as it may"
WARWICK,Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
KING HENRY VI,And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
WARWICK,And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
KING HENRY VI,"And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court."
KING HENRY VI,"Exeter, so will I."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee."
KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son."
KING HENRY VI,"Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
And given unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time?
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The duke is made protector of the realm;
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
Before I would have granted to that act.
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour"
KING HENRY VI,"Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak."
QUEEN MARGARET,Thou hast spoke too much already
KING HENRY VI,"Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Come, son, away; we may not linger thus."
KING HENRY VI,"Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The loss of those three lords torments my heart"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
Wrath makes him deaf"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
What! was it you that would be England's king?
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
And made a preachment of your high descent?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Look, York"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes."
QUEEN MARGARET,"What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears."
QUEEN MARGARET,And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
QUEEN MARGARET,"Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
So York may overlook the town of York.
3 KING HENRY VI"
WARWICK,"How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?"
WARWICK,"Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
I, then in London keeper of the king,
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
Bearing the king in my behalf along;
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought"
WARWICK,"Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
And for your brother, he was lately sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war."
WARWICK,"Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer."
WARWICK,"Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
And of their feather many more proud birds,
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore consent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the parliament;
And now to London all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong"
WARWICK,"No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York"
WARWICK,How now! what news?
WARWICK,"Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
3 KING HENRY VI"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown"
KING HENRY VI,"Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck"
KING HENRY VI,"Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
Inferring arguments of mighty force.
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
And would my father had left me no more!
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!"
QUEEN MARGARET,"My lord, cheer up your spirits"
KING HENRY VI,"Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune."
KING HENRY VI,"Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?"
WARWICK,"What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
Your legs did better service than your hands."
WARWICK,"Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine."
WARWICK,"'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence."
KING HENRY VI,"Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips."
KING HENRY VI,"I prithee, give no limits to my tongue"
WARWICK,"If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
For York in justice puts his armour on."
QUEEN MARGARET,"But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Stay, Edward."
WARWICK,"Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
I lay me down a little while to breathe;
For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile."
WARWICK,"How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?"
WARWICK,Then let the earth be drunken with our blood
WARWICK,"Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell."
KING HENRY VI,"This battle fares like to the morning's war,
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the wind"
KING HENRY VI,"O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief."
KING HENRY VI,"Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
The red rose and the white are on his face,
The fatal colours of our striving houses"
KING HENRY VI,"How will the country for these woful chances
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!"
KING HENRY VI,"Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much."
KING HENRY VI,"Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Here sits a king more woful than you are."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain"
KING HENRY VI,"Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter"
WARWICK,"No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
For, though before his face I speak the words
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave"
WARWICK,"From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
Instead whereof let this supply the room"
WARWICK,"I think his understanding is bereft.
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say."
WARWICK,"Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults."
WARWICK,"They mock thee, Clifford"
WARWICK,"Ay, but he's dead"
WARWICK,"Tut, that's a foolish observation"
KING HENRY VI,"From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed"
KING HENRY VI,"Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
For wise men say it is the wisest course."
KING HENRY VI,"My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
To wife for Edward"
KING HENRY VI,"More than I seem, and less than I was born to"
KING HENRY VI,"Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough."
KING HENRY VI,"My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to be seen"
KING HENRY VI,"But did you never swear, and break an oath?"
KING HENRY VI,Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
KING HENRY VI,"I was anointed king at nine months old;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me"
KING HENRY VI,"Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
And as the air blows it to me again,
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
And yielding to another when it blows,
Commanded always by the greater gust;
Such is the lightness of you common men.
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey."
KING HENRY VI,"So would you be again to Henry,
If he were seated as King Edward is."
KING HENRY VI,"In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd"
KING EDWARD IV,"Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror"
GLOUCESTER,"Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were dishonour to deny it her."
KING EDWARD IV,It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
GLOUCESTER,""
CLARENCE,""
GLOUCESTER,""
KING EDWARD IV,"Widow, we will consider of your suit;
And come some other time to know our mind."
GLOUCESTER,""
CLARENCE,""
GLOUCESTER,""
KING EDWARD IV,"How many children hast thou, widow? tell me."
CLARENCE,""
GLOUCESTER,""
GLOUCESTER,""
KING EDWARD IV,'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
KING EDWARD IV,"Lords, give us leave"
GLOUCESTER,""
KING EDWARD IV,"Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?"
KING EDWARD IV,And would you not do much to do them good?
KING EDWARD IV,"Then get your husband's lands, to do them good."
KING EDWARD IV,I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
KING EDWARD IV,"What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?"
KING EDWARD IV,But you will take exceptions to my boon.
KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask."
GLOUCESTER,""
CLARENCE,""
KING EDWARD IV,An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
KING EDWARD IV,"Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee."
GLOUCESTER,""
KING EDWARD IV,"But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean."
KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?"
KING EDWARD IV,"No, by my troth, I did not mean such love."
KING EDWARD IV,But now you partly may perceive my mind.
KING EDWARD IV,"To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee."
KING EDWARD IV,"Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands."
KING EDWARD IV,Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand."
GLOUCESTER,""
CLARENCE,""
KING EDWARD IV,""
KING EDWARD IV,"Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends;
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love."
KING EDWARD IV,"You cavil, widow"
KING EDWARD IV,"No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Have other some"
GLOUCESTER,""
CLARENCE,""
KING EDWARD IV,"Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had."
GLOUCESTER,"The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad."
KING EDWARD IV,You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
CLARENCE,"To whom, my lord?"
KING EDWARD IV,"Why, Clarence, to myself."
GLOUCESTER,That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
CLARENCE,That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
GLOUCESTER,By so much is the wonder in extremes.
KING EDWARD IV,"Well, jest on, brothers"
KING EDWARD IV,See that he be convey'd unto the Tower
GLOUCESTER,"Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
To cross me from the golden time I look for!
And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
The lustful Edward's title buried--
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself"
QUEEN MARGARET,"No, mighty King of France"
QUEEN MARGARET,"From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Is of a king become a banish'd man,
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done"
QUEEN MARGARET,"The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe."
QUEEN MARGARET,"O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
For this is he that moves both wind and tide."
WARWICK,"From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
And then to crave a league of amity;
And lastly, to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
To England's king in lawful marriage."
QUEEN MARGARET,""
WARWICK,""
QUEEN MARGARET,"King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
But from deceit bred by necessity;
For how can tyrants safely govern home,
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
That Henry liveth still"
WARWICK,Injurious Margaret!
WARWICK,"Because thy father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prince than she is queen."
WARWICK,"Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth."
WARWICK,"Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king."
WARWICK,And I the house of York.
QUEEN MARGARET,Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
WARWICK,Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
WARWICK,The more that Henry was unfortunate.
WARWICK,"Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant,
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
By this alliance to make void my suit"
WARWICK,"Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
You have a father able to maintain you;
And better 'twere you troubled him than France."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys."
WARWICK,"Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent."
QUEEN MARGARET,I told your majesty as much before
WARWICK,"King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend."
WARWICK,"So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake to land them on our coast
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?"
WARWICK,"And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours."
QUEEN MARGARET,Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
QUEEN MARGARET,"Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
And I am ready to put armour on."
WARWICK,"Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
There's thy reward"
WARWICK,"This shall assure my constant loyalty,
That if our queen and this young prince agree,
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine."
WARWICK,"I came from Edward as ambassador,
But I return his sworn and mortal foe"
GLOUCESTER,"Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?"
CLARENCE,"Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
How could he stay till Warwick made return?"
GLOUCESTER,And his well-chosen bride.
CLARENCE,I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?"
CLARENCE,"As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
That they'll take no offence at our abuse."
KING EDWARD IV,"Suppose they take offence without a cause,
They are but Lewis and Warwick"
GLOUCESTER,"And shall have your will, because our king"
KING EDWARD IV,"Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?"
GLOUCESTER,Not I
KING EDWARD IV,"Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
Should not become my wife and England's queen.
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
Speak freely what you think."
CLARENCE,Then this is mine opinion
GLOUCESTER,"And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage."
KING EDWARD IV,"What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise?"
CLARENCE,"For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford."
KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
And for this once my will shall stand for law."
GLOUCESTER,"And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your loving bride;
She better would have fitted me or Clarence"
CLARENCE,"Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere."
KING EDWARD IV,"Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee."
CLARENCE,"In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
Which being shallow, you give me leave
To play the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you."
KING EDWARD IV,"Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
And not be tied unto his brother's will."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My lords, before it pleased his majesty
To raise my state to title of a queen,
Do me but right, and you must all confess
That I was not ignoble of descent;
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
But as this title honours me and mine,
So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow."
KING EDWARD IV,"My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns"
GLOUCESTER,""
KING EDWARD IV,"Now, messenger, what letters or what news
From France?"
KING EDWARD IV,"Go to, we pardon thee"
KING EDWARD IV,"Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?"
KING EDWARD IV,"I blame not her, she could say little less;
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
For I have heard that she was there in place."
KING EDWARD IV,"Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
But what said Warwick to these injuries?"
KING EDWARD IV,"Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd"
CLARENCE,"Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
You that love me and Warwick, follow me."
GLOUCESTER,""
KING EDWARD IV,"Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
And haste is needful in this desperate case.
Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
Go levy men, and make prepare for war;
They are already, or quickly will be landed"
KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?"
GLOUCESTER,"Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you."
KING EDWARD IV,"Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
3 KING HENRY VI"
WARWICK,"Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?"
CLARENCE,"Fear not that, my lord."
WARWICK,"Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
And welcome, Somerset"
WARWICK,"This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
But follow me, and Edward shall be ours."
WARWICK,Richard and Hastings
KING EDWARD IV,"The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me king."
WARWICK,"Ay, but the case is alter'd"
KING EDWARD IV,"Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
Edward will always bear himself as king"
WARWICK,"Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king"
KING EDWARD IV,"What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
It boots not to resist both wind and tide."
WARWICK,"Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him seated in the regal throne.
3 KING HENRY VI"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"No, but the loss of his own royal person."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unawares"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
And I the rather wean me from despair
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb"
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
To set the crown once more on Henry's head"
GLOUCESTER,"Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
Thus stands the case"
KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, this way, man"
GLOUCESTER,"Brother, the time and case requireth haste"
KING EDWARD IV,But whither shall we then?
GLOUCESTER,"Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning."
KING EDWARD IV,"Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness."
GLOUCESTER,But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
KING EDWARD IV,"Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?"
GLOUCESTER,"Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado."
KING EDWARD IV,"Bishop, farewell"
KING HENRY VI,"Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?"
KING HENRY VI,"For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of household harmony
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
He was the author, thou the instrument.
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
And that the people of this blessed land
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
I here resign my government to thee,
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds."
WARWICK,"Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
For few men rightly temper with the stars"
CLARENCE,"No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
To whom the heavens in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
As likely to be blest in peace and war;
And therefore I yield thee my free consent."
WARWICK,And I choose Clarence only for protector.
KING HENRY VI,Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands
WARWICK,What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
CLARENCE,"That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
For on thy fortune I repose myself."
WARWICK,"Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content"
CLARENCE,What else? and that succession be determined.
WARWICK,"Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part."
KING HENRY VI,"But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat, for I command no more,
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed."
CLARENCE,"It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed."
KING HENRY VI,"My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?"
KING HENRY VI,"Come hither, England's hope.
If secret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me."
WARWICK,"What news, my friend?"
WARWICK,Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
WARWICK,"My brother was too careless of his charge.
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
A salve for any sore that may betide."
KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
And says that once more I shall interchange
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
And brought desired help from Burgundy"
GLOUCESTER,"The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within."
KING EDWARD IV,"Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us"
KING EDWARD IV,"But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York."
KING EDWARD IV,"Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
As being well content with that alone."
GLOUCESTER,""
GLOUCESTER,"A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!"
KING EDWARD IV,"So, master mayor"
GLOUCESTER,"Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived."
KING EDWARD IV,"Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?"
KING EDWARD IV,"Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest."
KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd."
GLOUCESTER,"Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?"
KING EDWARD IV,"When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim"
GLOUCESTER,"And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand"
KING EDWARD IV,"Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
And Henry but usurps the diadem."
KING EDWARD IV,"Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all"
WARWICK,"What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
And with his troops doth march amain to London;
And many giddy people flock to him."
KING HENRY VI,"Let's levy men, and beat him back again."
CLARENCE,"A little fire is quickly trodden out;
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench."
WARWICK,"In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
Those will I muster up"
KING HENRY VI,"Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope."
CLARENCE,"In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand."
KING HENRY VI,"Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!"
KING HENRY VI,"Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
And all at once, once more a happy farewell."
WARWICK,"Farewell, sweet lords"
KING HENRY VI,"Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine."
KING HENRY VI,That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame
KING EDWARD IV,"Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
And once again proclaim us King of England.
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow"
GLOUCESTER,"Away betimes, before his forces join,
And take the great-grown traitor unawares"
WARWICK,"Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?"
WARWICK,"How far off is our brother Montague?
Where is the post that came from Montague?"
WARWICK,"Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?"
WARWICK,"Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum."
WARWICK,"Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends."
KING EDWARD IV,"Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle."
GLOUCESTER,See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
WARWICK,"O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
That we could hear no news of his repair?"
KING EDWARD IV,"Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
And he shall pardon thee these outrages."
WARWICK,"Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York."
GLOUCESTER,"I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
Or did he make the jest against his will?"
WARWICK,"Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?"
GLOUCESTER,"Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give"
WARWICK,'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
KING EDWARD IV,"Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift."
WARWICK,Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight
KING EDWARD IV,But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner
GLOUCESTER,"Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower."
GLOUCESTER,"Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down"
WARWICK,"I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
And with the other fling it at thy face,
Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee."
KING EDWARD IV,"Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'"
WARWICK,O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
GLOUCESTER,"The gates are open, let us enter too."
KING EDWARD IV,"So other foes may set upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle"
WARWICK,"O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help."
GLOUCESTER,"Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear."
KING EDWARD IV,"The harder match'd, the greater victory"
GLOUCESTER,"Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold."
WARWICK,"And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brother's love!
Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call."
CLARENCE,"Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father's house,
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath"
KING EDWARD IV,"Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate."
GLOUCESTER,"Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike."
WARWICK,"O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!"
KING EDWARD IV,"What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?"
WARWICK,"Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
I will away towards Barnet presently,
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest."
KING EDWARD IV,"Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
3 KING HENRY VI"
KING EDWARD IV,"So, lie thou there"
WARWICK,"Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
That I must yield my body to the earth
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
To search the secret treasons of the world"
WARWICK,"Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead."
WARWICK,"Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven."
KING EDWARD IV,"Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
That will encounter with our glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bed"
CLARENCE,"A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it came"
GLOUCESTER,"The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her"
KING EDWARD IV,"We are advertised by our loving friends
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
What though the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
And Montague our topmost; what of him?
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks."
QUEEN MARGARET,"This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness."
KING EDWARD IV,"Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.
Therefore, no more but this"
KING EDWARD IV,"Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight"
QUEEN MARGARET,"So part we sadly in this troublous world,
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem."
KING EDWARD IV,"Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward, and he his life?"
GLOUCESTER,It is
KING EDWARD IV,"Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?"
QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!"
GLOUCESTER,"That you might still have worn the petticoat,
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster."
GLOUCESTER,"By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men."
GLOUCESTER,"For God's sake, take away this captive scold."
KING EDWARD IV,"Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue."
CLARENCE,"Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert."
KING EDWARD IV,"Take that, thou likeness of this railer here."
GLOUCESTER,"Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony."
CLARENCE,And there's for twitting me with perjury.
QUEEN MARGARET,"O, kill me too!"
GLOUCESTER,"Marry, and shall."
KING EDWARD IV,"Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much."
GLOUCESTER,"Why should she live, to fill the world with words?"
KING EDWARD IV,"What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery."
GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;
I'll hence to London on a serious matter"
CLARENCE,What? what?
GLOUCESTER,"The Tower, the Tower."
QUEEN MARGARET,"O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
If this foul deed were by to equal it"
KING EDWARD IV,"Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death"
CLARENCE,"By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease."
QUEEN MARGARET,"Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it."
CLARENCE,Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself"
KING EDWARD IV,"Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence."
QUEEN MARGARET,"So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!"
KING EDWARD IV,Where's Richard gone?
CLARENCE,"To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
To make a bloody supper in the Tower."
KING EDWARD IV,"He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
Now march we hence"
GLOUCESTER,"Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?"
KING HENRY VI,"Ay, my good lord"
GLOUCESTER,"Sirrah, leave us to ourselves"
KING HENRY VI,"So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?"
GLOUCESTER,"Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer."
KING HENRY VI,"The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
Have now the fatal object in my eye
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd."
GLOUCESTER,"Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office of a fowl!
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd."
KING HENRY VI,"I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
Than can my ears that tragic history.
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?"
GLOUCESTER,Think'st thou I am an executioner?
KING HENRY VI,"A persecutor, I am sure, thou art"
GLOUCESTER,Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
KING HENRY VI,"Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
And orphans for their parents timeless death--
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
To signify thou camest to bite the world"
GLOUCESTER,I'll hear no more
KING HENRY VI,"Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!"
GLOUCESTER,"What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
O, may such purple tears be alway shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither"
KING EDWARD IV,"Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain."
GLOUCESTER,""
KING EDWARD IV,"Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both."
CLARENCE,"The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe."
QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks."
GLOUCESTER,"And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit."
KING EDWARD IV,"Now am I seated as my soul delights,
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves."
CLARENCE,"What will your grace have done with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And hither have they sent it for her ransom."
KING EDWARD IV,"Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
And now what rests but that we spend the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy."
CAMILLO,"I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him."
CAMILLO,"Beseech you,--"
CAMILLO,You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
CAMILLO,"Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters,
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves!"
CAMILLO,I very well agree with you in the hopes of him
CAMILLO,"Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live."
LEONTES,"Stay your thanks a while;
And pay them when you part."
LEONTES,"We are tougher, brother,
Than you can put us to't."
LEONTES,One seven-night longer.
LEONTES,"We'll part the time between's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying."
LEONTES,"Tongue-tied, our queen?
speak you."
LEONTES,"Well said, Hermione."
LEONTES,Is he won yet?
LEONTES,"At my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
To better purpose."
LEONTES,"Never, but once."
LEONTES,"Why, that was when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love"
LEONTES,""
LEONTES,"I' fecks!
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain"
LEONTES,"Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
To be full like me"
LEONTES,"No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous"
LEONTES,"You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours?"
LEONTES,"So stands this squire
Officed with me"
LEONTES,To your own bents dispose you
LEONTES,"Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?"
CAMILLO,"Ay, my good lord."
LEONTES,"Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer."
CAMILLO,You had much ado to make his anchor hold
LEONTES,Didst note it?
CAMILLO,He would not stay at your petitions
LEONTES,"Didst perceive it?
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth"
CAMILLO,At the good queen's entreaty.
LEONTES,At the queen's be't
CAMILLO,"Business, my lord! I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer."
LEONTES,Ha!
CAMILLO,Stays here longer.
LEONTES,"Ay, but why?"
CAMILLO,"To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress."
LEONTES,"Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy penitent reform'd"
CAMILLO,"Be it forbid, my lord!"
LEONTES,"To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
From course required; or else thou must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it all for jest."
CAMILLO,"My gracious lord,
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
In every one of these no man is free,
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Where of the execution did cry out
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest"
LEONTES,"Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in that man that does not think,--
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
Or else be impudently negative,
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Before her troth-plight"
CAMILLO,"I would not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My present vengeance taken"
LEONTES,"Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
If this be nothing."
CAMILLO,"Good my lord, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis most dangerous."
LEONTES,"Say it be, 'tis true."
CAMILLO,"No, no, my lord."
LEONTES,"It is; you lie, you lie"
CAMILLO,Who does infect her?
LEONTES,"Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
About his neck, Bohemia"
CAMILLO,"Sir, my lord,
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a lingering dram that should not work
Maliciously like poison"
LEONTES,"Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Could man so blench?"
CAMILLO,"I must believe you, sir"
LEONTES,"Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down"
CAMILLO,"My lord,
Go then; and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer"
LEONTES,This is all
CAMILLO,"I'll do't, my lord."
LEONTES,"I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me."
CAMILLO,"O miserable lady! But, for me,
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion follows. If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Forsake the court"
CAMILLO,"Hail, most royal sir!"
CAMILLO,"None rare, my lord."
CAMILLO,"I dare not know, my lord."
CAMILLO,"There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
Of you that yet are well."
CAMILLO,I may not answer.
CAMILLO,"Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable"
CAMILLO,I am appointed him to murder you.
CAMILLO,By the king.
CAMILLO,"He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly."
CAMILLO,"Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body."
CAMILLO,I know not
CAMILLO,"It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns"
LEONTES,Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
LEONTES,"How blest am I
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected"
LEONTES,"I know't too well.
Give me the boy"
LEONTES,"Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus."
LEONTES,"You, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable"
LEONTES,"You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes"
LEONTES,"No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks."
LEONTES,Shall I be heard?
LEONTES,"Go, do our bidding; hence!"
LEONTES,Hold your peaces.
LEONTES,"Cease; no more.
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man's nose"
LEONTES,What! lack I credit?
LEONTES,"Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
We need no more of your advice"
LEONTES,"How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding"
LEONTES,"Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined,
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all."
LEONTES,Nor night nor day no rest
LEONTES,How does the boy?
LEONTES,"To see his nobleness!
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely"
LEONTES,"What noise there, ho?"
LEONTES,"How!
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged thee that she should not come about me"
LEONTES,"What, canst not rule her?"
LEONTES,Good queen!
LEONTES,Force her hence.
LEONTES,"Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door"
LEONTES,"Traitors!
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone."
LEONTES,He dreads his wife.
LEONTES,A nest of traitors!
LEONTES,"A callat
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
It is the issue of Polixenes"
LEONTES,"A gross hag
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
That wilt not stay her tongue."
LEONTES,"Once more, take her hence."
LEONTES,I'll ha' thee burnt.
LEONTES,"On your allegiance,
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
If she did know me one. Away with her!"
LEONTES,"Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
And see it instantly consumed with fire;
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight"
LEONTES,You're liars all.
LEONTES,I am a feather for each wind that blows
LEONTES,"It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding."
LEONTES,"Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
Of any point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
Without more mercy, to its own protection
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up."
LEONTES,"No, I'll not rear
Another's issue."
LEONTES,"Twenty-three days
They have been absent"
LEONTES,"This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart"
LEONTES,Read the indictment.
LEONTES,"I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first."
LEONTES,You will not own it.
LEONTES,"You knew of his departure, as you know
What you have underta'en to do in's absence."
LEONTES,"Your actions are my dreams;
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth"
LEONTES,Break up the seals and read.
LEONTES,Hast thou read truth?
LEONTES,There is no truth at all i' the oracle
LEONTES,What is the business?
LEONTES,How! gone!
LEONTES,"Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.
How now there!"
LEONTES,Take her hence
LEONTES,"Go on, go on
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest."
LEONTES,"Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth; which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son"
Clown,"Hilloa, loa!"
Clown,"I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
sky"
Clown,"I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And then for the
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
it"
Clown,"Now, now"
Clown,"I would you had been by the ship side, to have
helped her"
Clown,You're a made old man
Clown,"Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
he hath eaten"
Clown,"Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground."
CAMILLO,It is fifteen years since I saw my country
CAMILLO,"Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown"
CAMILLO,"I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note"
CAMILLO,I willingly obey your command.
AUTOLYCUS,"When daffodils begin to peer,
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service"
Clown,Let me see
AUTOLYCUS,""
Clown,"I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
raisins o' the sun."
AUTOLYCUS,O that ever I was born!
Clown,I' the name of me--
AUTOLYCUS,"O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
then, death, death!"
Clown,"Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee, rather than have these off."
AUTOLYCUS,"O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
ones and millions."
Clown,"Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
great matter."
AUTOLYCUS,"I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
me."
Clown,"What, by a horseman, or a footman?"
AUTOLYCUS,"A footman, sweet sir, a footman."
Clown,"Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee"
AUTOLYCUS,"O, good sir, tenderly, O!"
Clown,"Alas, poor soul!"
AUTOLYCUS,"O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
shoulder-blade is out."
Clown,How now! canst stand?
AUTOLYCUS,""
Clown,Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
AUTOLYCUS,"No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir"
Clown,What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
AUTOLYCUS,"A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
prince"
Clown,"His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
out of the court"
AUTOLYCUS,"Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well"
Clown,"Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig"
AUTOLYCUS,"Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
put me into this apparel."
Clown,Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia
AUTOLYCUS,"I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter"
Clown,How do you now?
AUTOLYCUS,"Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
walk"
Clown,Shall I bring thee on the way?
AUTOLYCUS,"No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir."
Clown,Then fare thee well
AUTOLYCUS,"Prosper you, sweet sir!
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too"
CAMILLO,"I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing."
CAMILLO,"He tells her something
That makes her blood look out"
Clown,"Come on, strike up!"
Clown,"Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Come, strike up!"
Clown,"He could never come better; he shall come in. I
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably."
Clown,"Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?"
Clown,Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
Clown,"You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
than you'ld think, sister."
AUTOLYCUS,"Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears"
Clown,"If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves."
Clown,"Is there no manners left among maids? will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering"
Clown,"Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?"
AUTOLYCUS,"And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoves men to be wary."
Clown,"Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here."
AUTOLYCUS,"I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge."
Clown,What hast here? ballads?
AUTOLYCUS,"Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
toads carbonadoed."
AUTOLYCUS,"Very true, and but a month old."
AUTOLYCUS,"Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?"
Clown,"Come on, lay it by"
AUTOLYCUS,"Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
ballad against the hard hearts of maids"
AUTOLYCUS,"Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
my pack will hold."
Clown,Lay it by too
AUTOLYCUS,"This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one."
AUTOLYCUS,"Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man"
AUTOLYCUS,"I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you."
AUTOLYCUS,"Get you hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know."
AUTOLYCUS,Neither.
AUTOLYCUS,Neither.
Clown,We'll have this song out anon by ourselves
AUTOLYCUS,"And you shall pay well for 'em.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Come to the pedlar;
Money's a medler.
That doth utter all men's ware-a."
CAMILLO,This shows a sound affection.
CAMILLO,"Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest."
CAMILLO,"Gracious my lord,
You know your father's temper"
CAMILLO,"Even he, my lord."
CAMILLO,Be advised.
CAMILLO,"This is desperate, sir."
CAMILLO,"O my lord!
I would your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need."
CAMILLO,"He's irremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see."
CAMILLO,"Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
That I have borne your father?"
CAMILLO,"Well, my lord,
If you may please to think I love the king
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction"
CAMILLO,"Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll go?"
CAMILLO,Then list to me
CAMILLO,"Sent by the king your father
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you as from your father shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down"
CAMILLO,"A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office, if they can but stay you
Where you'll be loath to be"
CAMILLO,"Yea, say you so?
There shall not at your father's house these
seven years
Be born another such."
CAMILLO,"I cannot say 'tis pity
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
To most that teach."
CAMILLO,"My lord,
Fear none of this"
AUTOLYCUS,"Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
to keep my pack from fasting"
CAMILLO,"Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt."
CAMILLO,Shall satisfy your father.
CAMILLO,"Who have we here?
We'll make an instrument of this, omit
Nothing may give us aid."
AUTOLYCUS,"If they have overheard me now, why, hanging."
CAMILLO,"How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee."
AUTOLYCUS,"I am a poor fellow, sir."
CAMILLO,"Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
thee"
AUTOLYCUS,"I am a poor fellow, sir.
I know ye well enough."
CAMILLO,"Nay, prithee, dispatch"
AUTOLYCUS,"Are you in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick on't."
AUTOLYCUS,"Indeed, I have had earnest"
CAMILLO,"Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into some covert"
CAMILLO,"No remedy.
Have you done there?"
CAMILLO,"Nay, you shall have no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend."
AUTOLYCUS,"Adieu, sir."
CAMILLO,""
CAMILLO,The swifter speed the better.
AUTOLYCUS,"I understand the business, I hear it"
Clown,"See, see; what a man you are now!
There is no other way but to tell the king
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood."
Clown,"Nay, but hear me."
Clown,"She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
and blood has not offended the king; and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
those things you found about her, those secret
things, all but what she has with her"
Clown,"Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by I know how much an ounce."
AUTOLYCUS,""
AUTOLYCUS,""
Clown,Pray heartily he be at palace.
AUTOLYCUS,""
AUTOLYCUS,"Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
thing that is fitting to be known, discover."
Clown,"We are but plain fellows, sir."
AUTOLYCUS,"A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
lying"
Clown,"Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
had not taken yourself with the manner."
AUTOLYCUS,"Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there"
AUTOLYCUS,What advocate hast thou to him?
Clown,Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant
AUTOLYCUS,"How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me as these are,
Therefore I will not disdain."
Clown,This cannot be but a great courtier.
Clown,He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical
AUTOLYCUS,"The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?"
AUTOLYCUS,"Age, thou hast lost thy labour."
AUTOLYCUS,"The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself"
AUTOLYCUS,"If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly"
Clown,"Think you so, sir?"
AUTOLYCUS,"Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman"
Clown,"Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
like you, sir?"
AUTOLYCUS,"He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead; then recovered again with
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their offences being so
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
men, what you have to the king"
Clown,He seems to be of great authority
AUTOLYCUS,After I have done what I promised?
AUTOLYCUS,"Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?"
Clown,"In some sort, sir"
AUTOLYCUS,"O, that's the case of the shepherd's son"
Clown,"Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
our strange sights"
AUTOLYCUS,"I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
go on the right hand"
Clown,"We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest."
AUTOLYCUS,"If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
not suffer me"
LEONTES,"Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
My blemishes in them, and so still think of
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Bred his hopes out of."
LEONTES,"I think so. Kill'd!
She I kill'd! I did so"
LEONTES,"Good Paulina,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
I know, in honour, O, that ever I
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips--"
LEONTES,"Thou speak'st truth.
No more such wives; therefore, no wife"
LEONTES,"She had; and would incense me
To murder her I married."
LEONTES,"Stars, stars,
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
I'll have no wife, Paulina."
LEONTES,"Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!"
LEONTES,"My true Paulina,
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us."
LEONTES,"What with him? he comes not
Like to his father's greatness"
LEONTES,"His princess, say you, with him?"
LEONTES,"Go, Cleomenes;
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
He thus should steal upon us."
LEONTES,"Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
He dies to me again when talk'd of"
LEONTES,"O my brother,
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
The adventure of her person?"
LEONTES,"Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?"
LEONTES,"The blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father,
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacred as it is, I have done sin"
LEONTES,Where's Bohemia? speak.
LEONTES,Who? Camillo?
LEONTES,You are married?
LEONTES,"My lord,
Is this the daughter of a king?"
LEONTES,"That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
That you might well enjoy her."
LEONTES,"Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Which he counts but a trifle."
LEONTES,"I thought of her,
Even in these looks I made.
But your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father"
AUTOLYCUS,"Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?"
AUTOLYCUS,I would most gladly know the issue of it.
AUTOLYCUS,"Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince"
Clown,"You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born"
AUTOLYCUS,"I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born."
Clown,"Ay, and have been so any time these four hours."
Clown,So you have
Clown,"Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are."
AUTOLYCUS,"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master."
Clown,Thou wilt amend thy life?
AUTOLYCUS,"Ay, an it like your good worship."
Clown,Give me thy hand
Clown,"Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
franklins say it, I'll swear it."
Clown,"If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his friend"
AUTOLYCUS,"I will prove so, sir, to my power."
Clown,"Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow"
LEONTES,"O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
That I have had of thee!"
LEONTES,"O Paulina,
We honour you with trouble"
LEONTES,"Her natural posture!
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seems."
LEONTES,"As now she might have done,
So much to my good comfort, as it is
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
I am ashamed"
CAMILLO,"My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner."
LEONTES,Do not draw the curtain.
LEONTES,"Let be, let be.
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Did verily bear blood?"
LEONTES,"The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
As we are mock'd with art."
LEONTES,"O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years together!
No settled senses of the world can match
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone."
LEONTES,"Do, Paulina;
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
There is an air comes from her"
LEONTES,"No, not these twenty years."
LEONTES,"What you can make her do,
I am content to look on"
LEONTES,Proceed
LEONTES,"O, she's warm!
If this be magic, let it be an art
Lawful as eating."
CAMILLO,She hangs about his neck
LEONTES,"O, peace, Paulina!
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
As I by thine a wife"
DUKE VINCENTIO,Escalus.
ESCALUS,My lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you"
ESCALUS,"If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo."
DUKE VINCENTIO,Look where he comes.
ANGELO,"Always obedient to your grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo"
ANGELO,"Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it."
DUKE VINCENTIO,No more evasion
ANGELO,"Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand"
ANGELO,The heavens give safety to your purposes!
ESCALUS,Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
ESCALUS,"I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place"
ANGELO,"'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point."
ESCALUS,I'll wait upon your honour.
LUCIO,"If the duke with the other dukes come not to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
the dukes fall upon the king."
LUCIO,"Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table."
LUCIO,"Ay, that he razed."
LUCIO,"I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
grace was said."
LUCIO,In any proportion or in any language.
LUCIO,"Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
controversy"
LUCIO,"I grant; as there may between the lists and the
velvet. Thou art the list."
LUCIO,"I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
feeling of thy speech"
LUCIO,"Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--"
LUCIO,Judge.
LUCIO,A French crown more.
LUCIO,"Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that are hollow"
LUCIO,"But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
Art thou sure of this?"
LUCIO,"Believe me, this may be"
LUCIO,Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
Provost,"I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge."
LUCIO,"Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?"
LUCIO,"If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
send for certain of my creditors"
LUCIO,"What, is't murder?"
LUCIO,Lechery?
Provost,"Away, sir! you must go."
LUCIO,"A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?"
LUCIO,"With child, perhaps?"
LUCIO,I warrant it is
LUCIO,"I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
like, which else would stand under grievous
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her."
LUCIO,Within two hours.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I do fear, too dreadful"
ISABELLA,And have you nuns no farther privileges?
ISABELLA,"Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare."
LUCIO,""
ISABELLA,Who's that which calls?
ISABELLA,Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
LUCIO,"Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?"
ISABELLA,"Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister."
LUCIO,"Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you"
ISABELLA,Woe me! for what?
LUCIO,"For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks"
ISABELLA,"Sir, make me not your story."
LUCIO,"It is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so"
ISABELLA,You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
LUCIO,"Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus"
ISABELLA,Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
LUCIO,Is she your cousin?
ISABELLA,"Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection."
LUCIO,She it is.
ISABELLA,"O, let him marry her."
LUCIO,"This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand and hope of action"
ISABELLA,Doth he so seek his life?
LUCIO,"Has censured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execution."
ISABELLA,"Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?"
LUCIO,Assay the power you have.
ISABELLA,"My power? Alas, I doubt--"
LUCIO,"Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them."
ISABELLA,I'll see what I can do.
LUCIO,But speedily.
ISABELLA,"I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you"
LUCIO,I take my leave of you.
ISABELLA,"Good sir, adieu."
ANGELO,"We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror."
ESCALUS,"Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you."
ANGELO,"'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes"
ESCALUS,Be it as your wisdom will.
ANGELO,Where is the provost?
Provost,"Here, if it like your honour."
ANGELO,"See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning"
ESCALUS,""
ANGELO,"How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?"
ANGELO,"Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
they not malefactors?"
ESCALUS,This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
ANGELO,Go to
ANGELO,"What are you, sir?"
ESCALUS,How know you that?
ESCALUS,How? thy wife?
ESCALUS,Dost thou detest her therefore?
ESCALUS,"How dost thou know that, constable?"
ESCALUS,By the woman's means?
ESCALUS,Do you hear how he misplaces?
ESCALUS,"Go to, go to"
ESCALUS,"Come, you are a tedious fool"
ESCALUS,"No, sir, nor I mean it not."
ANGELO,"This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there"
ESCALUS,"I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
Now, sir, come on"
ESCALUS,"Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?"
ESCALUS,"Ay, sir, very well."
ESCALUS,"Well, I do so."
ESCALUS,"Why, no."
ESCALUS,"He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?"
ESCALUS,"Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this true?"
ESCALUS,"If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
action of slander too."
ESCALUS,"Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
are."
ESCALUS,"Where were you born, friend?"
ESCALUS,Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
ESCALUS,"So. What trade are you of, sir?"
ESCALUS,Your mistress' name?
ESCALUS,Hath she had any more than one husband?
ESCALUS,"Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
tapsters"
ESCALUS,"Well, no more of it, Master Froth"
ESCALUS,What else?
ESCALUS,"Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true"
ESCALUS,"How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?"
ESCALUS,"But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed in Vienna."
ESCALUS,"No, Pompey."
ESCALUS,"There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you"
ESCALUS,"Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
prophecy, hark you"
ESCALUS,"Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?"
ESCALUS,"I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?"
ESCALUS,"Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
wrong to put you so oft upon 't"
ESCALUS,"Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
the most sufficient of your parish."
ESCALUS,"To my house. Fare you well.
What's o'clock, think you?"
ESCALUS,I pray you home to dinner with me.
ESCALUS,"It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy."
ESCALUS,It is but needful
Provost,"Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!"
ANGELO,"Now, what's the matter. Provost?"
Provost,Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
ANGELO,"Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?"
Provost,Lest I might be too rash
ANGELO,Go to; let that be mine
Provost,"I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour."
ANGELO,"Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed."
ANGELO,Hath he a sister?
Provost,"Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already."
ANGELO,"Well, let her be admitted.
See you the fornicatress be removed"
Provost,God save your honour!
ANGELO,"Stay a little while.
You're welcome"
ISABELLA,"I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me."
ANGELO,Well; what's your suit?
ISABELLA,"There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not."
ANGELO,Well; the matter?
ISABELLA,I have a brother is condemn'd to die
Provost,""
ANGELO,"Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done"
ISABELLA,"O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!"
LUCIO,""
ISABELLA,Must he needs die?
ANGELO,"Maiden, no remedy."
ISABELLA,"Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy."
ANGELO,I will not do't.
ISABELLA,"But can you, if you would?"
ANGELO,"Look, what I will not, that I cannot do."
ISABELLA,"But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?"
ANGELO,He's sentenced; 'tis too late.
LUCIO,""
ISABELLA,"Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you and you as he,
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern."
ANGELO,"Pray you, be gone."
ISABELLA,"I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
And what a prisoner."
LUCIO,""
ANGELO,"Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words."
ISABELLA,"Alas, alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
If He, which is the top of judgment, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
Like man new made."
ANGELO,"Be you content, fair maid;
It is the law, not I condemn your brother"
ISABELLA,"To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season"
LUCIO,""
ANGELO,"The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept"
ISABELLA,Yet show some pity.
ANGELO,"I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content."
ISABELLA,"So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant."
LUCIO,""
ISABELLA,"Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle"
LUCIO,""
Provost,""
ISABELLA,We cannot weigh our brother with ourself
LUCIO,"Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that."
ISABELLA,"That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy."
LUCIO,""
ANGELO,Why do you put these sayings upon me?
ISABELLA,"Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault"
ANGELO,""
ISABELLA,"Gentle my lord, turn back."
ANGELO,I will bethink me
ISABELLA,Hark how I'll bribe you
ANGELO,How! bribe me?
ISABELLA,"Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you."
LUCIO,""
ISABELLA,"Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal."
ANGELO,Well; come to me to-morrow.
LUCIO,""
ISABELLA,Heaven keep your honour safe!
ANGELO,""
ISABELLA,"At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?"
ANGELO,At any time 'fore noon.
ISABELLA,'Save your honour!
ANGELO,"From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hail to you, provost! so I think you are."
Provost,"I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly."
Provost,"I would do more than that, if more were needful.
Look, here comes one"
DUKE VINCENTIO,When must he die?
Provost,"As I do think, to-morrow.
I have provided for you"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?"
JULIET,I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put on."
JULIET,I'll gladly learn.
DUKE VINCENTIO,Love you the man that wrong'd you?
JULIET,"Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?"
JULIET,Mutually.
DUKE VINCENTIO,Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
JULIET,"I do confess it, and repent it, father."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis meet so, daughter"
JULIET,"I do repent me, as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite!"
JULIET,"Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!"
Provost,'Tis pity of him.
ANGELO,"When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel"
ANGELO,"Teach her the way.
O heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive"
ISABELLA,I am come to know your pleasure.
ANGELO,"That you might know it, would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live."
ISABELLA,Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
ANGELO,"Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I yet he must die."
ISABELLA,Under your sentence?
ANGELO,Yea.
ISABELLA,"When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not."
ANGELO,"Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid"
ISABELLA,"'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth."
ANGELO,"Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?"
ISABELLA,"Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul."
ANGELO,I talk not of your soul
ISABELLA,How say you?
ANGELO,"Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this"
ISABELLA,"Please you to do't,
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity."
ANGELO,"Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity."
ISABELLA,"That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer."
ANGELO,"Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine"
ISABELLA,"Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
But graciously to know I am no better."
ANGELO,"Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross"
ISABELLA,So.
ANGELO,"And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain."
ISABELLA,True.
ANGELO,"Admit no other way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
What would you do?"
ISABELLA,As much for my poor brother as myself
ANGELO,Then must your brother die.
ISABELLA,And 'twere the cheaper way
ANGELO,"Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?"
ISABELLA,"Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses"
ANGELO,"You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice."
ISABELLA,"O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean"
ANGELO,We are all frail.
ISABELLA,"Else let my brother die,
If not a feodary, but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness."
ANGELO,"Nay, women are frail too."
ISABELLA,"Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints."
ANGELO,I think it well
ISABELLA,I have no tongue but one
ANGELO,"Plainly conceive, I love you."
ISABELLA,"My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for it."
ANGELO,"He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love."
ISABELLA,"I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others."
ANGELO,"Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose."
ISABELLA,"Ha! little honour to be much believed,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't"
ANGELO,"Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation overweigh,
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein"
ISABELLA,"To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will"
DUKE VINCENTIO,So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life"
ISABELLA,""
Provost,Who's there? come in
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again."
ISABELLA,My business is a word or two with Claudio.
Provost,"And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Provost, a word with you."
Provost,As many as you please.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed."
ISABELLA,"Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger"
ISABELLA,"None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain."
ISABELLA,"Yes, brother, you may live"
ISABELLA,"Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined scope."
ISABELLA,"In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked."
ISABELLA,"O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies."
ISABELLA,"There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die"
ISABELLA,"O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed."
ISABELLA,"Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow."
ISABELLA,"O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin."
ISABELLA,"Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow."
ISABELLA,Which is the least?
ISABELLA,What says my brother?
ISABELLA,And shamed life a hateful.
ISABELLA,"Alas, alas!"
ISABELLA,"O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed"
ISABELLA,"O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word."
ISABELLA,What is your will?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
by have some speech with you"
ISABELLA,"I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures"
DUKE VINCENTIO,Hold you there
Provost,"What's your will, father"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
awhile with the maid"
Provost,In good time.
DUKE VINCENTIO,The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good
ISABELLA,I am now going to resolve him
DUKE VINCENTIO,That shall not be much amiss
ISABELLA,"Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?"
ISABELLA,"I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed"
ISABELLA,Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour"
ISABELLA,"What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world! What corruption in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,It is a rupture that you may easily heal
ISABELLA,"Show me how, good father."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection"
ISABELLA,"The image of it gives me content already; and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo"
ISABELLA,"I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father."
DUKE VINCENTIO,O heavens! what stuff is here
DUKE VINCENTIO,"And you, good brother father. What offence hath
this man made you, sir?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!"
LUCIO,"How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Still thus, and thus; still worse!"
LUCIO,"How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
still, ha?"
LUCIO,"Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
so"
LUCIO,"Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell"
LUCIO,"Well, then, imprison him"
LUCIO,"No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage"
DUKE VINCENTIO,And you.
LUCIO,"Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?"
LUCIO,"Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
what news?"
LUCIO,"Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
What news, friar, of the duke?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,I know none. Can you tell me of any?
LUCIO,"Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he is in Rome"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well."
LUCIO,"It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
puts transgression to 't."
DUKE VINCENTIO,He does well in 't.
LUCIO,"A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it."
LUCIO,"Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
it is well allied"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"How should he be made, then?"
LUCIO,"Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to be true"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace."
LUCIO,"Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
a thousand"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not inclined that way."
LUCIO,"O, sir, you are deceived."
DUKE VINCENTIO,'Tis not possible.
LUCIO,"Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"You do him wrong, surely."
LUCIO,"Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
duke"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"What, I prithee, might be the cause?"
LUCIO,"No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
teeth and the lips"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Wise! why, no question but he was."
LUCIO,"A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking"
LUCIO,"Sir, I know him, and I love him."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
dearer love."
LUCIO,"Come, sir, I know what I know."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain it"
LUCIO,"Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
report you."
LUCIO,I fear you not.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again."
LUCIO,I'll be hanged first
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Why should he die, sir?"
LUCIO,"Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of were returned again"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?"
ESCALUS,Go; away with her to prison!
ESCALUS,"Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant."
Provost,"A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
your honour."
ESCALUS,That fellow is a fellow of much licence
Provost,"So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
advised him for the entertainment of death."
ESCALUS,"Good even, good father."
DUKE VINCENTIO,Bliss and goodness on you!
ESCALUS,Of whence are you?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time"
ESCALUS,What news abroad i' the world?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"None, but that there is so great a fever on
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it"
ESCALUS,"One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know himself."
DUKE VINCENTIO,What pleasure was he given to?
ESCALUS,"Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
any thing which professed to make him rejoice"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"He professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice"
ESCALUS,"You have paid the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"If his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself."
ESCALUS,I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Peace be with you!
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things!
Craft against vice I must apply"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised here to meet."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?"
ISABELLA,"He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening with this bigger key"
DUKE VINCENTIO,But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
ISABELLA,I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?"
ISABELLA,"No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
I come about my brother."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good."
ISABELLA,I do desire the like.
DUKE VINCENTIO,Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee"
ISABELLA,"She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too."
ISABELLA,"Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract"
Provost,"Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?"
Provost,"Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper"
Provost,"What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?"
Provost,"Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd."
Provost,"Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
the scale."
Provost,Are you agreed?
Provost,"You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
to-morrow four o'clock."
Provost,Call hither Barnardine and Claudio
Provost,"Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself.
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio.
Welcome father."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?"
Provost,"None, since the curfew rung."
DUKE VINCENTIO,Not Isabel?
Provost,No.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"They will, then, ere't be long."
Provost,What comfort is for Claudio?
DUKE VINCENTIO,There's some in hope.
Provost,It is a bitter deputy.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice"
Provost,"There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?"
Provost,"None, sir, none."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning."
Provost,"Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we"
DUKE VINCENTIO,And here comes Claudio's pardon.
Provost,I shall obey him.
DUKE VINCENTIO,""
Provost,"I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Pray you, let's hear."
Provost,""
DUKE VINCENTIO,"What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon?"
Provost,"A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
that is a prisoner nine years old."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"How came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so."
Provost,His friends still wrought reprieves for him
DUKE VINCENTIO,It is now apparent?
Provost,"Most manifest, and not denied by himself."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seems he to be touched?"
Provost,"A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and desperately mortal."
DUKE VINCENTIO,He wants advice.
Provost,He will hear none
DUKE VINCENTIO,"More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
provost, honesty and constancy"
Provost,"Pray, sir, in what?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,In the delaying death.
Provost,"A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo."
Provost,"Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death"
Provost,"Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?"
Provost,"To him, and to his substitutes."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
avouch the justice of your dealing?"
Provost,But what likelihood is in that?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
duke"
Provost,I know them both.
DUKE VINCENTIO,The contents of this is the return of the duke
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, sir, you must"
DUKE VINCENTIO,But hear you.
DUKE VINCENTIO,Unfit to live or die
Provost,"Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable."
Provost,"Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo"
Provost,"This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio"
Provost,I am your free dependant.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly"
Provost,Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours."
Provost,I'll make all speed.
ISABELLA,""
DUKE VINCENTIO,"The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither"
ISABELLA,"Ho, by your leave!"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter."
ISABELLA,"The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"He hath released him, Isabel, from the world"
ISABELLA,"Nay, but it is not so."
DUKE VINCENTIO,It is no other
ISABELLA,"O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!"
DUKE VINCENTIO,You shall not be admitted to his sight.
ISABELLA,"Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity"
ISABELLA,I am directed by you.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return"
LUCIO,"Good even. Friar, where's the provost?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Not within, sir."
LUCIO,"O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes so red"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them."
LUCIO,"Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well."
LUCIO,"Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough."
LUCIO,I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
DUKE VINCENTIO,Did you such a thing?
LUCIO,"Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well."
LUCIO,"By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end"
ESCALUS,Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
ANGELO,"In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness"
ESCALUS,I guess not.
ANGELO,"And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
they should exhibit their petitions in the street?"
ESCALUS,He shows his reason for that
ANGELO,"Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house"
ESCALUS,"I shall, sir. Fare you well."
ANGELO,"Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"These letters at fit time deliver me
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste"
ISABELLA,To speak so indirectly I am loath
ISABELLA,"Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end."
ISABELLA,"O, peace! the friar is come."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you."
ANGELO,Happy return be to your royal grace!
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital."
ANGELO,You make my bonds still greater.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand;
And good supporters are you."
ISABELLA,"Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice"
ISABELLA,"O worthy duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil"
ANGELO,"My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm"
ISABELLA,By course of justice!
ANGELO,And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
ISABELLA,"Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nay, it is ten times strange."
ISABELLA,"It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Away with her! Poor soul,
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense."
ISABELLA,"O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness."
ISABELLA,"O gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?"
ISABELLA,"I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo"
LUCIO,"That's I, an't like your grace"
ISABELLA,That's he indeed.
DUKE VINCENTIO,You were not bid to speak.
LUCIO,"No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it"
LUCIO,I warrant your honour.
DUKE VINCENTIO,The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
ISABELLA,"This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--"
LUCIO,Right.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed."
ISABELLA,"I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--"
DUKE VINCENTIO,That's somewhat madly spoken.
ISABELLA,"Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter."
DUKE VINCENTIO,Mended again. The matter; proceed.
ISABELLA,"In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter"
DUKE VINCENTIO,This is most likely!
ISABELLA,"O, that it were as like as it is true!"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself"
ISABELLA,"And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?"
ISABELLA,"One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?"
LUCIO,"My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the man"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found."
LUCIO,"But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?"
LUCIO,"My lord, most villanously; believe it."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
First, let her show her face, and after speak."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"What, are you married?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,Are you a maid?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"A widow, then?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Why, you are nothing then"
LUCIO,"My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife."
DUKE VINCENTIO,Silence that fellow
LUCIO,"Well, my lord."
LUCIO,"He was drunk then, my lord"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!"
LUCIO,"Well, my lord."
DUKE VINCENTIO,This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
ANGELO,Charges she more than me?
DUKE VINCENTIO,No? you say your husband.
ANGELO,This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
DUKE VINCENTIO,Know you this woman?
LUCIO,"Carnally, she says."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sirrah, no more!"
LUCIO,"Enough, my lord."
ANGELO,"My lord, I must confess I know this woman"
ANGELO,I did but smile till now
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Ay, with my heart
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Go do it instantly.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement"
ESCALUS,"My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?"
LUCIO,'Cucullus non facit monachum
ESCALUS,"We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him"
LUCIO,"As any in Vienna, on my word."
ESCALUS,"Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her."
LUCIO,"Not better than he, by her own report."
ESCALUS,Say you?
LUCIO,"Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
she would sooner confess"
ESCALUS,I will go darkly to work with her.
LUCIO,That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
ESCALUS,"Come on, mistress"
LUCIO,"My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
the provost."
ESCALUS,In very good time
LUCIO,Mum.
ESCALUS,"Come, sir"
DUKE VINCENTIO,'Tis false.
ESCALUS,How! know you where you are?
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak."
ESCALUS,The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse."
LUCIO,This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
ESCALUS,"Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What 'unjust'!"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own"
ESCALUS,Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
ANGELO,"What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?"
LUCIO,"'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice"
LUCIO,"O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Most notedly, sir."
LUCIO,"Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
that my report"
LUCIO,"O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
ANGELO,"Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
treasonable abuses!"
ESCALUS,"Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him"
DUKE VINCENTIO,""
ANGELO,"What, resists he? Help him, Lucio."
LUCIO,"Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him."
LUCIO,This may prove worse than hanging.
DUKE VINCENTIO,""
ANGELO,"O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?"
ANGELO,"I was, my lord."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost."
ESCALUS,"My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince"
ISABELLA,"O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty!"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"You are pardon'd, Isabel"
ISABELLA,"I do, my lord."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
To buy you a better husband."
DUKE VINCENTIO,Never crave him; we are definitive.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death!
Now, sir, to you."
DUKE VINCENTIO,Against all sense you do importune her
DUKE VINCENTIO,He dies for Claudio's death.
ISABELLA,"Most bounteous sir,
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?"
Provost,It was commanded so.
DUKE VINCENTIO,Had you a special warrant for the deed?
Provost,"No, my good lord; it was by private message."
DUKE VINCENTIO,For which I do discharge you of your office
Provost,"Pardon me, noble lord"
DUKE VINCENTIO,What's he?
Provost,His name is Barnardine.
DUKE VINCENTIO,"I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him."
ESCALUS,"I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward."
ANGELO,I am sorry that such sorrow I procure
DUKE VINCENTIO,Which is that Barnardine?
Provost,"This, my lord."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd"
Provost,"This is another prisoner that I saved.
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself."
DUKE VINCENTIO,""
LUCIO,"'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
had rather it would please you I might be whipt."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her"
LUCIO,"I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke"
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed."
LUCIO,"Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
whipping, and hanging."
DUKE VINCENTIO,"Slandering a prince deserves it.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo"
